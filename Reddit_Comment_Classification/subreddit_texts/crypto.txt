!!comment!!: According to my crystal ball of RSI math: Target 33k, then crash to 25-28k for weekly and daily RSI reset then pump to 41k to claim it.
this will play in the next 18-60 days.

ETH RSI maths: 2300 then crash to 1800-1900, for daily/weekly RSI reset then push to 3200 target 18-60 days to play this.

After 41k or new target 51k BTC, ETH 3200 or new target 3700, major crash for reset. -30% to -37% then slowly will go back up to ATH before halving event.
Source of prediction: according to my crystal ball RSI-maths.

So, did I sell? Nope

Have I learned anything? Also nope
!!comment!!: How many Bitcoin miners does it take to change a light bulb?

!!comment!!: What a day! finally can afford egg on my ramen
!!comment!!: Crypto world actually depresses me a lot sometimes. Seeing how people constantly get their accounts drained so simply just by connecting their wallet somewhere, and then checking those scammers wallets seeing how they earned hundreds of thousands from doing that with no repercussions is just sickening.

There is lack of justice in crypto world, and a lot of time the worst kind of people with no morals get on top here.

Twitter is pretty much junk now (and still searching for rock bottom) so idk how much sway this will really have beyond a few dog-coin pumps
!!comment!!: And here we go with ETH to $2K today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs have some of that throwback good feelings of 2021.  Long ETH!
!!comment!!: I remember when ETH was 3 digits
!!comment!!: Finally, ETH/BTC ratio begun going up again (reached 0.66).

I was 100% into BTC, converted 25% of it to ETH when the ratio was 0.71. I'm still slightly salty about it, but when ETH really starts going up it becomes unstoppable for a long time, I'm cautiously optimistic.

!!comment!!: Some desperate bear out there is thinking about shorting 31k. After getting liquidated @21k, @27k and 29k. 

While everyone is riding these beautiful green candles.

BTC is ruthless, when it goes, it goes.

!!comment!!: ETH just hit 2.1k loving this green feels like Christmas ü§©

!!comment!!: Just watched btc hit $30k. 
- *It was a good day*
!!comment!!: For anyone who still doubted $15K was the bear market bottom, I think those doubts are starting to fade.

Bitcoin went from $15K to $30K, while having a war in Ukraine, inflation, Fed rate hikes, worldwide recessions, banks crumbling, fear of war between China and Taiwan, the SEC going after Binance, etc...

If Bitcoin can double under those conditions, imagine if those things start to cool off.

!!comment!!: All I want is a modest 1000x
!!comment!!: This heart on my head is HUGE and its for all you daily peeps ‚ò∫Ô∏è
!!comment!!: Eth pumping. Is it due to Shanghai upgrade?
!!comment!!: **Sha**nghai - Upgrading execution layer of ETH

Ca**pella** - Upgrading consensus layer of ETH

!!comment!!: Just spent $99 on a JPG. What the fuck is wrong with me??
!!comment!!:  "prominent cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz, shared his thoughts on Bitcoin's surge above $30,000 in a recent CNBC interview, noting that it has not been driven by institutional investors"

!!comment!!: Snapshot reminder: don't forget to smile
!!comment!!: BTC sucking liquidity from alts.
!!comment!!: The daily: ‚ÄúMy Reddit NFT didn‚Äôt 100x immediately, what a waste. ü§¨‚Äù
!!comment!!: Can't believe [THIS](https://np.reddit.com/u/me) is the person who botched the Reddit Gen 3 Launch
!!comment!!: I‚Äôm so ready to unload another half of my algo. The deeper I go the more I‚Äôm just not liking it.

The tech is great. But the design of the ‚Äúexpert governor‚Äù platform makes me think there‚Äôs not much thought happening at the foundation.

We‚Äôre just voting to give algo to more ecosystem projects? Really, that‚Äôs it? A year of hype, just for more pointless voting?

I would have been happier if they upgraded vanilla governance, than this overly complicated system.

What are they even trying to accomplish?
!!comment!!: Alts nearly dumped the whole pump from yesterday‚Ä¶
!!comment!!: I bought 500 coins to test if I could pay Reddit with my credit card.

!!comment!!: Moon

Snapshot: 00D 02H 54M 09S
!!comment!!: BTC being a lil tease today üòè
!!comment!!: What did you guys do to 30k while I was gone
!!comment!!: So is this Shangai thing out yet
!!comment!!: As someone who has been accumulating BTC as much as possible for a year now, especially below 20K BTC, I have to say I'm starting to feel like there isn't much upside in the short term anymore for BTC when I'm buying at 30k so I will stop for now. I even took some profits at 30K with the belief I can buy back at a lower price (I set an order at 25K to buyback). I believe BTC will rise in the long term but I have a feeling we are close to a local top. I can definitely be wrong but this uncomfortable feeling is enough for me to sit out for now. Good luck to all the DCA'ers, I hope I'm wrong and BTC pumps to a million in the coming 2 months!
!!comment!!: Whoot! I'm gonna breach 500 moons! This means I'll be in the 500-100,000 moons category instead of the 0-499 category.
!!comment!!: Omg the app is fixed‚Ä¶ yay!!!
!!comment!!: We should be able to buy avatars in future with Moons!
!!comment!!: Anyone get any of the new NFTs? I picked up like 6 lol
!!comment!!: I think I throw a party for my todays Cake Day ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
!!comment!!: Get your suits ready, get a haircut, shave, because it's snapshot day
!!comment!!: Who will bless the new DD with the first Snek?
!!comment!!: If anyone is looking to provide LP for MOON/ETH, and wondering how much it rewards then I can tell you that:

It gives around 1 moon per day with $280 worth of MOON/ETH in LP
!!comment!!: Today is snapshot day! What are you hopes and dreams? On my side I hope for a ratio over 0.7 and at least 500 moons
!!comment!!: Coolest Avatar for under $10 ??? What should I grab? üòÅ
!!comment!!: Looking forward for the day we will be able to buy avatars with moons!
!!comment!!: It would actually be super convenient to be able to buy Avatars, using our Moons..  üôå
!!comment!!: Next Avatar Gen4 we want to buy them with our MOONs
!!comment!!: Moon snapshot day, last chance to farm up that extra karma!
!!comment!!: Oof, Reddit, google play, and my bank all disagree about how many charges there should be... We'll see how that turns out üòÖ
!!comment!!: Bitcoin looking it has solid $30k support for right now. üí™üèª

*kicks rocks*    
*folds arms*    
***pouts***
!!comment!!: Last chance to last chance
!!comment!!: Anyone knows why alts ran off a cliff?
!!comment!!: We below 30k, again? Guys... I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.
!!comment!!: Congrats on 30k. Moving in the right direction.
!!comment!!: GEN 3 gone, welcome Snapshot. There's always something exciting to look forward to in this space.
!!comment!!: Alts running off a cliff in anticipation of CPI data is one of the predictable things in crypto.
!!comment!!: Sold my $ARB airdrop when it started to dump. Paid off my new fridge and two months DCA into BTC so not bad for a freebie.
!!comment!!: Happy snapshot day everyone. I'm hoping to hit double figures this time round.
!!comment!!: Does the snapshot provide you with the ratio and therefore amount of moons we will receive?
!!comment!!: What is this in queu to be minted bs its has been 8 hours since i bought is this thing coming from the depths of the ocean or something
!!comment!!: Good morning, everybody. Snapshot day. Hoping for a good distribution.

It‚Äôs not a super popular post so far but that‚Äôs ok with me as it gives me enough time to check each reply and have some conversations!

I‚Äôd like to make more posts in the future if I find something that‚Äôs relevant and interesting or useful. I‚Äôve held off on posting since I‚Äôve joined for that reason but I‚Äôm working on engaging more! I just wanted to share my excitement so far :D

I was a lurker for a long time, before this profile and moons existed. Feels nice to contribute.

!!comment!!: What do you guys reckon will be the bear market low of btc for the next cycle?

!!comment!!: I expect to become rich instantly with crypto.
!!comment!!:  2018 ledger was new to people. I leaned this from last time though. When Legders start to get sold out, and new 'experts' start preaching about keys and asking how to use them. That is the time I will sell, not store.

the easiest part was recovering access to hot wallets and exchanges, thanks to backups.    
the worst part was reclaiming access to some banking applications using mobile as token. no way to backup.

!!comment!!: All I want is a Porsche and never having to work again a day in my life.

!!comment!!: If the next halving creates a bull run like expected, it feels too easy. Buy now and make profits next year everyone's expecting? 

It feels like it's just too easy and expected that's why it won't happen the way we anticipate it.

I feel like in 2018 the atmosphere was probably that crypto is legitimately dead whereas in 2022 it was just "next bull". 

Anyone else?

!!comment!!: Find someone who loves you like BTC loves going back to 28k.
!!comment!!: People keep wondering about the price dipping after Microstrategy buys most times. But I think its a chicken and egg issue. Perhaps MS buying is a part of what pushed the market up, or keeps it level due to their buy pressure spread over several days weeks. And then when they let up, gravity brings things down without that buy pressure to support or extend the rallies.
!!comment!!: To keep up with Balaji's prediction, the on-day average for Bitcoin has to be around $225k by end of today.

Often it is not a matter of chasing the coin that gives you 10% more profit but more about the 30% life expenses you can save on unnecessary things.

!!comment!!: The value of MOONS has been plumetting ever since the news of the hack on Sushiswap. 

I went to check my LP and stake in Sushi and I couldn't find it in the "My positions" tab, but when I went directly to the LP, I could still see my stake. 

As of the writing moment: The LP contains $308.5k worth of MOONS and $325.8k worth of ETH.

- CPI and fed minutes on Wednesday

It‚Äôs almost 11 pm Sunday night and it‚Äôs time for bed!

Market is crabbing. Gen 3 Reddit avatars are about to drop in a day or so. 

The avatar mashup contest is also ending too - on the day gen 3 is scheduled to drop on April 10. Up to 2,000 moons up for grabs. 

Also on that same day we are doing a Trivia 4 Moons event with a total of 1,000 moons up for grabs too. 

Make sure you join in to the trivia!

Good night everyone!

!!comment!!: I've often thought about signing up to sushiswap, but I'm so lazy when it comes to crypto. It's a great way to protect yourself.

Buy, stake, and hodl. Everything else can wait until tomorrow.
!!comment!!: pretty quiet day in crypto. Gonna DCA and chill... stick to the plan!

!!comment!!: I like the green, keep going !
!!comment!!: With all the recent hacks and exploits I see on this subreddit I am glad to keep it simple and just buy Bitcoin without any of the other noise.

Seems too risky and requires you to constantly keep up to date with the news to avoid having your investments stolen.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: How often do you think people lie around here? Sometimes I feel people just write "Did my DCA today" because they know that's what others want to hear & that it might earn them some moons.
!!comment!!: with the rise of cbdc, its wise to dca some xmr no?

!!comment!!: If anyone has been using sushiswap there‚Äôs some kind of vulnerability/hack.

There‚Äôs a post about it. I don‚Äôt use sushiswap, so it‚Äôs a bit over my head but I don‚Äôt want anyone losing any coins‚Ä¶so please read the post.
!!comment!!: A whale opened a 53x long ($13M) on Btc and 34x long on Eth ($1.2M), his ETH long has most probably already liquidated, BTC is still above that price.    

What if he now cancels his BTC long? Can the price shoot back up?

I think it was on purpose, he is probably buying lot of cheaper ETH while the price is still down. May we now see $2000 ETH?
!!comment!!: Sushiswap hacked.

!!comment!!: Who was affected by the SushiSwap hack? Share what happened
!!comment!!: There was a comment with URL to revoke access in MetaMask. Anybody has it ?
!!comment!!: Kind of insane how Sushiswap just gets hacked, it's fully their fault, and they do not have any legal obligation to return users their stolen funds even though fault lies completely on them. They just tell people: hey revoke all permissions from us and good luck. Something has to change.
!!comment!!: I hate to say it but Im withdrawing my mooms from sushiswap. I was part of the LUNA fiasco and I got ptsd from those days. I know its not their fault but still :/
!!comment!!: People where shaming others for using CEX, and that they should use DEX instead. And to sum up, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still safer to user Kraken/Coinbase, etc
!!comment!!: Maybe I‚Äôm in the minority but I found Sushi to be sketchy since the dev mass dumped back a couple years ago.

!!comment!!: Some of these cryptos go down more often than my ex.

But not on me
!!comment!!: I want a brief explanation why these gen 3 avatars have so much value / potential and the hype behind them. A short video or article will be fine

And how am I supposed to buy them ? Where and how (currency) ? (I never bought an avatar on Reddit so excuse my ignorance)

2 Who has the final say on the distribution of Moon - the subreddit or Reddit?

3 If Reddit plays a significant role in the token distribution, is it possible that they may one day decide to merge all tokens into one?

!!comment!!: NOOB question. If I use a software wallet, transfer my crypto and then store the 12 words somewhere on paper, does deleting the software wallet app effectively make it a cold wallet (since it now only exists on paper)? I ask because suggestions are that having a hot wallet app on your device is not that secure since it's connected to the interwebs.

!!comment!!: OK guys so I have a gaming buddy that lives in Germany, my neighbouring country. We've known each other for 15 years and game pretty much daily. We've seen each other several time IRL and I trust him.

He has no idea I'm into crypto and I have no intention of telling him. HOWEVER, he just told me his cat, who is about 5 years old, needs surgery. He can't afford it. He's seriously considering just putting it to sleep because he has no choice, but I know it would break his heart (and mine to be honest, I hate seeing animals suffer)

5% of my portfolio is ADA. The rest is BTC and ETH. I'm seriously considering selling my ADA... that would be enough to cover for the surgery. I would never ask this money back because I know he doesn't really earn a lot. This would be purely a gift.

Don't know what to do. I know it will sting if ADA reaches another ATH especially since I bought it back in the days when it was sub 0.10‚Ç¨ but on the other hand, I wouldn't forgive myself if he put his cat down because I was too greedy.

Wouldn't tell him where I got the money from though. My crypto stuff is strictly confidential. It's really just "here, I pay for your cat, no questions asked"

https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/tx/0xad3cedb117c19db26f72516108ee9398fc4e4a7f7d70b389e13a0f5928c1cd5b

This typically means someone has rented the banner, or intends to host a sponsored AMA. Due to the large burn in this particular case, it's more likely they've booked the banner for a long period of time.

So who is our next banner renter? Well, there may be some clues.

The [0x155] address that burned the moons had purchased them on SushiSwap with roughly 10 ETH. The ETH used here came from another [0xE5A] address, mostly in this transaction:

https://nova.arbiscan.io/tx/0x6ab108b08d0237569183f9f586ce78e578c562644c7956016860404aac2c90ee

And that [0xE5A] address was first funded with 11.1 ETH from another [0x31E] address in this transaction:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ef6e4c2939ec24a8f1dc3cff42e82a7ee7c93be1501b11fcac5470c93ccbfde

Now this [0x31E] address is very special, in that it has sent/received almost **$380 million** from Nexo:

https://i.imgur.com/QeDjZm6.jpg

Could it be that our next sponsored banner is Nexo Exchange? At the very least, we can say this person/entity is a very large customer of theirs.

!!comment!!: I‚Äôve realized the hardest thing to do is be patient with dry powder to lump sum. I have plenty of exposure already so I‚Äôm waiting for a price closer to 17-20k. I guess I‚Äôm trying to time the bottom but maybe not the absolute bottom. And if I miss it that‚Äôs ok. Of course because this is my strategy the bottom is already 100% in.
!!comment!!: two major ways to look at this price level. interdasting confluence as always  


crabbing sideways bouncing ontop of the 236 of the retracement from the high on the btcusd chart; and if you divide it by gold then we are sitting at the 2017 peak, kinda looks like some miners have been stacking bars recently  


make no mistake, we do not want commodities to go up. that is not good, bearish for the economy  


as gold goes up, the s2fx value goes up. the december low looks like it was the cost of production and chain maintenance floor.

!!comment!!: This might be the dumbest move I've made this year, but Im rotating some BTC into alts here. 

Looking at the BTC.D breakdown, I can't help but think that BTC will crab here for some time, while alts still have a lot of room to pump.
!!comment!!: Of course I can be completely wrong, but I feel continued success for Bitcoin is inevitable. It‚Äôs been deemed valuable by humans for what 14 years now? Bitcoin continues to grow & a healthy rate & is accepted by governments. Even the SEC with the regulatory mess going on has already said it is not a security. I don‚Äôt see why or how it can not continue to grow in use & value

Tips are anonymous, so while I responded to a few comments with my appreciation, definitely missed some people and wanted to thank everyone who chipped in. Maybe they'll see or be referred to this comment later. I never expect or need donations to keep the website running, but it certainly lightened my mood today when I saw them
!!comment!!: remember when cramer said to sell your bitcoin last week?
!!comment!!: After many months of deep red, my btc finally almost even lol

Bought on the way up back in April 21, got rekt ofc, been steady DCA since then and brought avg price down to 29.6k. Was very slow at work for a few months and I couldn‚Äôt accumulate nearly as much as I would have liked during the 14-18k days.  

So close! Kinda bittersweet with the pumping, was enjoying these lower prices but good to also see some solid recovery.

!!comment!!: I decided I wanted to go down the rabbit hole on how to buy and sell moons so that when the day comes when I do ever want to sell I will be ready and know what to expect.

The whole process needs to be more simple.

I consider myself to be pretty technically inclined and even I struggled.

You have to know how to import your seed phrase into your wallet, import a custom token, Learn the ins and outs of a DEX, learn about layers and coin swapping, all sorts of different fees and 8 days waiting time to bridge from arbitrum nova back to main net.

If you ever want to sell or buy moons I highly suggest taking your time, do your research and send a small test amount at first.

I was dumb and sent some ethereum from arbitrum network to the main net wallet and lost it.

!!comment!!: Can someone explain to me how you actually make money with liquidity pools? Yes, you get a cut of the fees. But how does it compare to HODLing an asset? Unless it only moves sideways, I can't see how it is particularly profitable even with 300-400% APR if the price moves significantly in a few months window. I know that seems kinda strange to say. But, unless its a small/new coin, why would you not just HODL or stake (one sided)?

With impermanent loss and slippage, does this not ruin all your gains?

Gotta save space for the same old worthless garbage I guess.

So strange that they didn't pump along with BTC last time. I understand BTC dominance, but still it was weird.
!!comment!!: Feels like yesterday I jokingly asked in here (when everyone was very bearish) what if BTC never goes below 20K ever again. Now it genuinely looks like a possibility.

Another scenario is that maybe Arbitrum team will respond with a reasonable explanation but I really doubt it. They are really late on this...
!!comment!!: I don't get it why people are hoping for btc to go down to 20k.. Why didn't you guys bought when it was hovering around 15k for a month? When btc hits 20k, These are the same people who will say waiting for btc to hit 10k to buy at those juicy prices..

!!comment!!: I added to the MOONS/ETH LP on Sushi exactly 44 hours ago. 

My LP yields are almost non-existent. 

Staking the LP has given me rewards that are worth about 0.01 MOON per hour with an initial investment of 100 MOONS and 0.015 ETH (about 57$ worth at the time). 

My impermanent loss is at 0.44% or 0.259$.

My yields are about 0.235% or 0.13$.

This gives a real APR of around 46.8% compared to the 48.29% announced on the staking site.

!!comment!!: Welp... idk if I fell for the FUD or not, but I swapped off my ARB drop... 

I've held a few projects that have shit the bed and I've seen significant hits for not selling when I had the chance (JUNO I'm looking at you).... truth be told, I don't have a whole lot I can afford to spare, but I do what I can wo jeopardizing my family and there's positions I just can't chase.... 

So I put 1/2 into MOON and the other 1/2 is slated for BTC dips 

PS any good DEX to swap ETH for BTC?

!!comment!!: What will change if certain cryptocurrencies are deemed a security,

Like apart from the whole financial freedom aspect what changes in terms of making money off crypto if it is deemed a security? From my understanding it will just come under the regulations of the SEC but nothing changes in terms of gaining a profit from the project? If that is the case then this fear of crypto becoming a security is just because the financial freedom aspect of it gets taken away if im correct? Please share your thoughts as i want to understand why there is such fear of SEC taking over crypto.
!!comment!!: BTC has been holding up pretty well despite being in my range resistance hmmm
!!comment!!: Man the blue chip Nfts are dropping like rocks, undecided if its the bottom to pick up a moonbird or clone x. Azuki has been holding up well.

!!comment!!: For new folks just getting into crypto and Reddit avatars..

Don‚Äôt forget to set up your Reddit Vault. Write down and keep your seed phrase that it generates for you safe. Don‚Äôt share it with any strangers, no matter how convincing they may seem.

Also, if you‚Äôre planning on buying avatars via the Reddit shop on drop day, make sure to have your payment methods set and ready to go. 

If you‚Äôre buying on an iPhone or Android, have your gift card balance loaded (great plan to avoid your bank issuing a ‚ÄúFraud Alert‚Äù because of rapid purchases. Can be purchased online or at most gas stations or stores for Apple and Google Play Store gift cards.) And don‚Äôt forget about adding a credit/debit card or two as a backup as well.

Next week is going to be FUN! These leaks coming out are already badass. Have fun!

!!comment!!: A coin like Moons that only have around a 100 million coins in Total Supply, at .34 cents is wild! It's crazy because the potential is huge with such a small amount of coins to go around for everyone.. I swear the only way from here is up.. Considering the past 12 months, while most of the Crypto was in the red, Moons were going up.. + 560% !! And this is just the beginning too.. 

We just need one big exchange to list us, and it's gonna spread like a wild fire.

!!comment!!: Thanks everyone for the great reception on the [pokemon cards](https://ccmoons.com/card) I made for avatars!

Since people seemed to enjoy them, I'll probably create at least one more iteration of them (but it'll be a few months from now at least). Curious to hear your thoughts on any changes I should make.

My first ideas:

1. Fewer "Normal" types. Even though it's one of the most common types in the game, I don't think anyone thinks they're interesting. I'll add other types (Ice, Dark, etc.)
2. More rarity tiers, with a slightly more even distribution
3. Enter two usernames and simulate a battle. This will be very simplistic, likely just outputted text sentences about the result and no animations.

!!comment!!: I just made 17$ using leverage and now I feel like a genius. RIP, write my obituary now‚Ä¶.üòÇ
!!comment!!: This Balaji guy who's betting 1 million on BTC hitting 1 million in three months probably has other, much bigger bets on Bitcoin hitting 30k or 40k in three months. He's just hoping to create enough hype, possibly even Elon commenting on Bitcoin again, to make his actual money bets come true.

!!comment!!: Forget this 1 million in 90 day‚Äôs prediction, id be pretty happy with just 100k in 90 days :)
!!comment!!: When we hit 32k it‚Äôll just be like day one when I bought my first piece of a BTC

!!comment!!: My post got removed for karma restriction so I was told to post here.

Accepting crypto at my small business - what have you used as customers and as a business?
ADVICE
I am the owner of a small business and I am interested in accepting crypto payments from my customers. My business is a drive-thru coffee shop so I need payments to be fast and can't have someone holding up the line for 5+ minutes trying to make their crypto payment. I am trying to figure out what options have been used by other businesses and customers.
As a business owner, what crypto payment options have you used to accept payments? Which ones have you found to be the most user-friendly, fast and secure? As a customer, have you ever used crypto to make purchases? Which payment options have you found to be the most convenient, fast, and reliable?
Any advice, tips, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you in advance for your help!
!!comment!!: Well got a 12 HR overtime shift today but it's more money for ETH

!!comment!!: I have a new boat obsession and damn, they're expensive. So can we get a bull run already? Please?
!!comment!!: BTC is gold and ETH is silver
!!comment!!: Watching the sub completely flip the script on NFTs because of these Reddit avatars is kinda crazy. This sub has insane doublethink capabilities. 

Another example is how any other coin with the structure of Moons would be hailed as a shitcoin. Penalizing use case? Voting to artificially raise the price by limiting sales?

!!comment!!: Let's spread that positivity the few of you here. Snapshot day looming, let's all get a ton of Moons!
!!comment!!: Binance US def has low to zero (ETH and BTC) trading fees, but those withdrawal fees are criminal. 

The other day I bought some BTC with zero trading fees on binance but it cost me $5.88 in fees to withdraw.

I also bought some BTC on Coinbase for $0.40 in trading fees and a $0.75 withdrawal fee.

Also, the ACH deposits on Coinbase seem to be instant now and I was able to withdraw right away with no hold on my funds. Pretty nice feature for those that want to withdraw to a cold wallet and not hold any funds on an exchange.
!!comment!!: Please use the sideways market to accumulate more. 

I've been in the space since 2017 and made large profits. 

Still, the only regret I have is not buying more during bear markets.

!!comment!!: This price action is so boring
!!comment!!: Ohai 28k nice to see you again
!!comment!!: My swing trading strategy:

Only trade coins your comfortable holding for the long term. Buy on 5% dips and sell on 5% gains. Have a separate holding portfolio so you‚Äôre still exposed to 5%+ gains. Don‚Äôt risk more than 10% of your trading portfolio on one trade. 

This has worked well for me so far. Sometimes I go multiple weeks without executing a trade. I only trade when there‚Äôs a clear opportunity. 

Thoughts?

I wouldn‚Äôt have gathered half the information and new things I‚Äôve learned just in these four months in even a years time if I was alone without being able to turn to this sub for help! Thank you for anyone who‚Äôs helped me that sees this and I hope everyone has a wonderful Easter I love all my CC sub fam :D <3

!!comment!!: It's really touching to see how fierce of a support level $28k has been.
!!comment!!: So as long as you have your wallet id and seed phrase your crypto is safe? Or is there more to it?
Ps this is a simple question about holding crypto not about prices or projects crashing. Thanks in advance for answering my dumb question
!!comment!!: I know it‚Äôs gonna sound like a stupid question, but what happens to our debt/mortgage if a CBDC rolls out? 

The reason I ask is when I sign any loan or mortgage agreement, I agreed to repay X amount of USD. If USD tanks in value due to the CBDC rollout, would we not theoretically be able to purchase USD with the new shitcoin CBDC (that our bank balances have now then been converted to) at a severe discount and pay off the debt for a fraction of the ‚Äúprice‚Äù?
!!comment!!: Whatever happened to that GME NFT store?

!!comment!!: Ohh lol i just learned something about hex in their sub

So one guy had it stacked until 2031 and needed the money and unstacked.. you know what happens ? Yeah all his crypto goes poof then and gets paid to others

Like how do you invest into this shit and think its a sane idea lol

Just imagine for a moment the BTC you bought just vanshes from you and others get it because you wanted to take profit 

Profit you can only do via staking for 10-20 years. If you take it out to soon.. it lets you. But then your tokens just all vanish into other peoples wallets

We have people that defend this crap on /cc

How do these people get away with this ? Safemoon v1 v2 same story.. didnt read some vague discord post somwhere and want to sell v1? Yeah 100% tax bro and of course the dev¬¥s get them and can sell them lol

How do people see these "features" and decide to buy it lol
!!comment!!: Another day, another dip caused by US regulations

Every one of these dips were actually healthy for the overall trend. 

If we were in 2022, news like these would take BTC down -12% instantly. *Not anymore, the narrative is just too strong now, money isnt safe in banks, might aswell put it in magic internet money*
!!comment!!: Is there any case where moons shouldn‚Äôt be called a shitcoin? 

It just cheapens discussion. Why do we need governance? what does it provide? CCIPs have moved on from governing anything to just manifesting new means to prop up the price to later dump on someone else. Whales single handedly voted to limit sells as a means to artificially limit sales, which destroys use-cases in general. 

If *any* other coin did this, it would be rightfully called a shitcoin.

!!comment!!: For anyone who wasn‚Äôt around last bull market. If history repeats itself here‚Äôs how it goes..

BTC pumps to all time highs = alts get dragged along barely on dollar value but die on BTC pair.

Along the way there will be dips that make you doubt it‚Äôs a bull market = alts get rekt 

Once BTC has a new all time high and is trading sideways or upwards very slowly = alt season 

Random alts will do insane numbers and normally starts with ETH pumping.

!!comment!!: The secret to selling moons THEY don't want you to know: You need 4 apps/sites. Metamask (for importing your Reddit vault moons), novafaucet (for ETH on the Nova Arbitrum Network, needed for gas) Sushiswap (for exchanging Moons to USDC or ETH), and [orbiter.finance](https://orbiter.finance) (For bridging that USDC/ETH back to the Ethereum Network).
!!comment!!: Why is so many excited about ARB? Is it a good project?
!!comment!!: Whales forgot that we're crazy enough to hold and keep buying.
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|QBMjDd1ei2JyJvbzeq)

SEC's movements towards Crypto isn't a question of 'if' they are trying to tank the market. It's 'why'.  
  
From the movements, it seems that crypto is too uncontrollable and it might deter the strength of USD. I reckon that their move is to 'blanket' crypto by targeting stablecoins, and use the Digital Currencies by CBDCs as the new stable coins.  
  
This way, they can trace every transactions from in and out of crypto.

!!comment!!: Can anyone explain why mods received 25k Moons this round?

There were 200k moons to share among 14 mods from what I know

200 000/14 = 14 285

Shouldnt they get 14k Moons instead 25k Moons?
!!comment!!: Well.

Well.

Well.

Color me impressed. Not only is MEXC good for purchasing moons, but I just discovered that you can send eth directly to arb one address, no worrying about bridging. Not sure if that's new, but I feel like a few months back I had to send eth to mainnet and then go to arb bridge site. Maybe I was just taking extra steps.

!!comment!!: I'm very happy with the new avatars!
!!comment!!: Defi question. For those of you who know, how do you claim fee rewards from providing liquidity on Sushi? for example on uniswap, there is a big "CLAIM" button with a number there. I can't find anything like that on sushiswap. Am I being stupid and missing something obvious? Also what is the "total assets" counter at the bottom, above the pool size? It is something like $10 for me, which doesn't make sense unless those are my rewards?

Please help. Thanks!
!!comment!!: Moons payday and my generosity extends to my wife who is now doing grocery shopping at a local drugstore. (Why drugstores in Japan don‚Äôt just sell medicines is beyond me though). Gave her 5000 yen (about 50 bucks) n felt on top of the world !

!!comment!!: Would you guys continue to move up the corporate chain where you get more responsibilities and higher salary or stay in sort of a sweet spot where the salary is decent enough and you have a limited set of responsibilities you can efficiently complete?
!!comment!!: What an eventful day!! Kept F5 for more than an hour for the arb airdrop, as the website kept crashing. Then I went to the contract address via arbiscan, and called directly the "claim" method to get my tokens! (risky, but it worked!). Tried many times to sell on uniswap, it kept failing no matter how I increased the slippage. Checked on kraken and I saw it was already trading, sent the arbs to Kraken via the arb network, it would also fail until I changed the fee to something outrageous like 20 (4$ transaction cost). Got them into Kraken, managed to sell them at 1.41$.

Never ever won the lottery, or a ruffle, or anything like that. And here I am, someone just gave me this money for free. Unbelievable.
!!comment!!: As someone who didn't get the ARB airdrop, this whole daily is speaking another language to me.
!!comment!!: Bobbing up and down between 27-28 isn‚Äôt too shabby. Better than being under 25.
!!comment!!: Do Kwon‚Äôs arrest makes all this red totally ok.
!!comment!!: There are about 400 absolutely unknown shitcoins with more market cap than Moons, who‚Äôs buying them? I don‚Äôt get it.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting it, more just thinking aloud about the situation‚Ä¶ ten years ago ‚ÄúI sold crypto to cover a vet bill‚Äù would be a nonsense sentence. She disappeared for a month after working out how to pick open the doggy door. I thought she was gone forever, but a few nights ago I found her huddled up against the fence which backs onto an empty field. Unfortunately, as soon as I picked her up, I felt that she was bleeding. She‚Äôs getting stitched up today, and I hope she‚Äôll be back to her old self soon.
!!comment!!: Hey everyone, I'm the guy running crypto for the homeless. For those of you who don't know already, we are a 501c3 (nonprofit) organization completely founded and developed on reddit. We have currently raised enough funds to last us for the next decade or so - and our claim to fame is that we spend almost all of our funds solely on food/goods for the homeless (we have zero overhead/administrative fees/salary). Everyone who works for us is doing it volunteer/pro-bono.  
  
This is not the end-all be-all solution for homelessness, but it is a great proof of concept that shows what can be done with minimal resources to make a real scaling solution to help out homeless people. We have a network of volunteers that are currently working very regularly and getting reimbursed in crypto (which allows international volunteers to receive reimbursements without any barriers).  
  
Currently, this year we are focusing on getting a couple people recruited on the team that have skills in social media. Specifically youtube/tik tok/reddit. I am looking for someone who believes in this project willing to learn and work consistently as a team member! There are some benefits that come with it as well:  
  
If you are full-time (30 hours a week minimum) you qualify for PSLF (student loan forgiveness).  
  
All members will receive their own company email address.  
  
Office 365 access as well as google workspace access.  
  
Another thing we are looking for are sponsors. I always loved the idea of collaborations no matter how small - and even if it's a link exchange I would absolutely love to work together/collaborate/link exchange with other organizations that we can get behind.  
  
Thanks again! Don't hesitate to reach out to me or respond here.

But I'm done DCAing, I'll find some other shitcoin to pour my money into.

On the other hand this could be a good time to buy it during max fud, but I doubt it. Probably just dies like nano etc. This myAlgo hack really  was the last straw in the eyes of most investors it feels like.

!!comment!!: Hey everyone, I'm the guy running crypto for the homeless. For those of you who don't know already, we are a 501c3 (nonprofit) organization completely founded and developed on reddit. We have currently raised enough funds to last us for the next decade or so - and our claim to fame is that we spend almost all of our funds solely on food/goods for the homeless (we have zero overhead/administrative fees/salary). Everyone who works for us is doing it volunteer/pro-bono.  
  
This is not the end-all be-all solution for homelessness, but it is a great proof of concept that shows what can be done with minimal resources to make a real scaling solution to help out homeless people. We have a network of volunteers that are currently working very regularly and getting reimbursed in crypto (which allows international volunteers to receive reimbursements without any barriers).  
  
Currently, this year we are focusing on getting a couple people recruited on the team that have skills in social media. Specifically youtube/tik tok/reddit. I am looking for someone who believes in this project willing to learn and work consistently as a team member! There are some benefits that come with it as well:  
  
If you are full-time (30 hours a week minimum) you qualify for PSLF (student loan forgiveness).  
  
All members will receive their own company email address.  
  
Office 365 access as well as google workspace access.  
  
Another thing we are looking for are sponsors. I always loved the idea of collaborations no matter how small - and even if it's a link exchange I would absolutely love to work together/collaborate/link exchange with other organizations that we can get behind.  
  
Thanks again! Don't hesitate to reach out to me or respond here.

!!comment!!: Years ago when BTC would run, alts would pause, then when BTC would pause, alts would run. Anyone see this happening soon? Anyone buying a alts right now for a swing trade hoping that when this BTC run pauses alts will spike?
!!comment!!: Can‚Äôt decide if I should buy more BTC or if I‚Äôm too late in this rally so I should buy ETH instead assuming that alts will get a delayed rally at some point.

!!comment!!: Can we start a kraken listing moons post like we do with Coinbase listing VET on Thursday?

!!comment!!: Gentlemen, I am proud of you for holding the 25k line
!!comment!!: I feel like someone should teach an internet safety course for those that need to learn internet understandings.

!!comment!!: Let's hope Jim Cramer makes a shitty comment about Bitcoin soon would be nice if includes some bearish emojis too this time

!!comment!!: Pay credit card debt AND invest in crypto?

Here‚Äôs my dilemma.

I have a job that pays $85k a year. I have ~$59k in credit card debt and ~$34k in federal student loan debt. I am not too concerned about the student loans due to low interest rates (~3-4%) with a possibility of $10k of the ~$34k being forgiven if the Student Debt Relief Plan passes. I do have an ongoing 401(k) loan with 4.25% interest that I took out (~$12k) during the COVID-19 pandemic to invest‚ÄîI have a remaining balance of ~$7k.

Personally, I have had decent returns on my crypto investments (>80%) over the last 2 years that puts my investments at ~85k. Of course, my goal is to be debt-free, but I also want to have some more skin in the markets this year because I see a lot of buying opportunities coming in and out throughout 2023 due, in part, to macroeconomics, particularly around interest rates and inflation. This could offer big rewards, of course at a bigger risk, in the crypto space.

Here is a breakout of my assets and liabilities (not including housing and other expenses):

- Cash: $60,000
- Crypto Investments: $85,000
- TOTAL ASSETS: $145,000

- Credit Cards: $59,000
- Student Loans: $34,000
- 401(k) Loan: $7,000
- TOTAL LIABILITIES: $100,000

Here is a breakout of my credit cards:

- Chase #1 - $1,900/$2,000 at 26.74% APR
- Chase #2 - $18,400/$18,500 at 20.49% APR
- Chase #3 - $2,960/$3,000 at 19.49% APR
- Chase #4 - $20,900/$20,500 at 24.49% APR
- Discover - $4,115/$4,200 at 22.49% APR
- Citi - $7,660/$8,250 at 19.24% APR
- Target Card - $3,450/$3,500 at 27.15% APR

Here is my credit score so far - it was at 730+ before the loans for investments:

- TransUnion: 591
- Equifax: 581
- Experian: 585

One missed opportunity was that I could have taken profits from my investments when the return was much higher in 2021 to cover my initial investments and pay debt.

Next Steps:
I am thinking about using the $60k in cash to pay off Chase #2 ($18,400) and Chase #4 ($20,900). Invest the remaining ~$20k in crypto to take advantage of dips in the market throughout 2023. When the bull market comes back in a year or so, I would have made my money work for me to pay off the other credit cards including the interest incurred.

Of course, I have the option of using the cash to pay off all of my credit card debt, but then I feel like I would be capping my potential return.

Hey guys I know that these past 2 years Moons have been indispensable for many users , I‚Äôve heard stories people (especially in developing countries ) are making more money with Moons  than their salary of their day to day job . Even one of my mate who lives in the US told me he bought a used car ( around $5000) for his fianc√® , funny thing he was even unemployed at that particular time .

Hopefully that's several hours of learning that will come in handy! Thanks for all the help folks.

!!comment!!: I just wanna rant for a second. I had around 3.1 eth sitting in robinhood. I know, robinhood bad, but I converted my stocks to it when the market took a fat dump a few months ago. I‚Äôm originally from NY but am currently attending med school in Poland. for context, crypto transfers aren‚Äôt available in NY on robinhood so I messaged support saying I haven‚Äôt lived in NY since Jan 8th to see if I‚Äôd be able to enable transfers. whelp that was my mistake because now I got an email saying they‚Äôre closing my account, forcing me to liquidate my crypto having held it on their for less than a year. now i‚Äôm forced to take a short term capital gains tax or potentially end up losing access to both my account and the crypto stored on it. ok, rant over

In Q2 2019 it went above both before dropping below both when covid hit in March 2020. Didn't return to being above both until Q2 2020.

Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is currently 46.17%, a decrease of 0.00% over the day.
!!comment!!: I like to think my brief week trip to Korea last week was the catalyst for Kwon to panic and get caught.
!!comment!!: So I just got an email from Celsius that they reached a settlement of 72% of your custody account. The funny thing is that most Celsius users don't keep their crypto in custody doing nothing, it's mostly in earn account earning rewards. Settlement is not for Earn account. 


Now here's where I might have gotten lucky because a day before withdrawal locked up I moved my Link into Custody account preparing to withdraw. I checked my email from Celsius showing me my claims and sure enough my Chainlink is in Custody account. So there is actually a chance I can get 72% of my Chainlink back if I opt in the Settlement. 


There's hope for me after all boys!
!!comment!!: Awarded the daily a SNEK, may the markets be green
!!comment!!: Good morning! ‚òïÔ∏è how are we feeling?

!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - March 13, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: Hey gang, come join us for the final podcast livestream on r/cryptocurrency today at 730pm UTC | 330pm ET. 

Reddit is deprecating the Talk feature, so we will have to find a new home after this episode.

To celebrate over 50 episodes with you here on Reddit, we'll invite a few up to chat with us along the way. Very spicy week ahead, a lot to talk about.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11qcisa/weekly\_rcc\_crypto\_chat\_at\_730pm\_utc\_330pm\_et/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11qcisa/weekly_rcc_crypto_chat_at_730pm_utc_330pm_et/)
!!comment!!: In the past week we've seen.

>Fed going full hawkish

>Biden proposing a 30% tax on electricity used for BTC mining

>Silvergate collapsing

>SVB collapsing

>USDC deppeggging and CB stopping redemptions causing a contagion across all stable coins with USDC reserves.

>Algorand and Hedera both got hacked within a week 


And still BTC held onto $20k and bounced through all the FUD...I think its safe to say that 15k was bottom. Congratulations to all the hard headed who stuck around. our suffering will not go in vain.
!!comment!!: Not gonna lie. Became a wholecoiner today. Feels good.
!!comment!!: Banks fail, and BTC rises 18%. This is the way.

!!comment!!: If CPI comes in cool tomorrow, 30k BTC is on the table
!!comment!!: Glad my DCA was this weekend
!!comment!!: CDC card update: Investigation resolved!

Finally. After 2 months since I lodged my ticket to report multiple unauthorized transactions made on my CDC Visa card, the case is concluded and CDC have reimbursed me for the funds lost.

Early January I noticed 4 transactions, totalling $287 AUD which I did not make; eventually discovered to be 4 different American dating websites. After some emails back and forth, and verification with their support, and finally lodging the official notice to dispute transactions, it took another month until the case was finally resolved in my favour.

Phew!
!!comment!!: I started buying crypto in February last year, so I've had very little to cheer about up until now. But BTC pumping 10%+ twice in a week is quite exciting, I won't lie.

!!comment!!: banks just bailed out btc by sacrificing themselves
!!comment!!: The fed gave the banks 25 billion tomorrow morning guaranteed credit‚Ä¶. That means tonight they can flip 25 billion into crypto and pocket some profits.   Nice to have friends in the fed.  You go SVB.  SBF must be jealous.
!!comment!!: If you don‚Äôt like Bitcoin at 19k you don‚Äôt deserve it at 22k
!!comment!!: People who entered crypto for the 1st time 24 hrs ago:

!!comment!!: I thought today was gonna be one of the most red days in history? That‚Äôs what everyone told me on Saturday, so I guess no one actually knows shit about fuck?
!!comment!!: Banking debacle and low CPI tomorrow could be the pivot we have been waiting for. 50bps is most likely off the table, and possibly also 25bps

Could get really spicy tomorrow!
!!comment!!: my ass is ready. bring it.
!!comment!!: this pump is exactly what will happen when banks go bankrupt/economy tanks, crypto/gold rip to moon, fed prints more money, everything ok, prices go down, feels like a test run, bullish on crypto's future as usual, this pump confirms it, hold tight, they cant keep doing this fiat ponzi fractional (with zero fractional reserves per 2020 rule change) banking scam much longer, and we know CBDC's are in the works
!!comment!!: In case anyone was wondering, about 2 hours ago a nice whale withdrew 24 ETH from Coinbase, converted to wETH, and began purchasing moons on SushiSwap:

https://i.imgur.com/8Tot5uU.jpg

https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/address/0x74e22bAC2065A4716bC10ad291531539857DF3cE/token-transfers#address-tabs

In total, they now have 175,000 moons.

This large purchase caused moons to pump from around 25c to 30c.

!!comment!!: Been commenting regularly on this sub for 5 years and still not a single moon. For the love of crypto, Can somebody help me get into the moon game. Activated vault. Still nothing ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
!!comment!!: So PNC Bank passed on buying out SVB. And because no other banks stepped forward, the Treasury Dept, Federal Reserve, and FDIC will issue a loan to cover all SVB customers funds. Basically, they lied and printed more money.

I really wonder if this and coming weeks, more banks start to teeter. If anyone knows anything or heard anything about another collapsing, definitely post it here.  Speak up! Would-be great to outplay our corrupt financial system and punish them for their malfeasance.

*  Vitalik bought 400k in USDC and 27k in DAI. He made 10% profit in USDC ($40k) and $2,160 in DAI.
* FED came in rescuing SVB and assured clients would recover all their money.
*  Many times before, Stablecoins lost their parity with the dollar. Most of it is created by FUD from competitors.- SVB is secured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) wich can secure up to 94% of it's funds.
*  USDC is the only stablecoin backed up by the company the "rules the world", Blackrock.
*  Bank of England wants to buy SVB get it back on it's feet.

!!comment!!: Middle of the week! We‚Äôre getting there folks! Then we can have a breather from these accursed fiat mines
!!comment!!: 
Goddamn these stocks are tearing me a new one. 

The pessimist in me says crypto is just lagging a bit behind and the red sea is imminent.

The optimist in me left in 2018
!!comment!!: Reddit is having a stroke again today it seems
!!comment!!: Good night everyone, the snapshot is only 30 mins, we did our best, congrats to everyone especially to those who opened their vault.
!!comment!!: Anyone else feeling great with that 0.7ish ratio?
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|TT7JW4Qm7uaNW|downsized)

Finally... Reddit... has come back... online!

That means bull run is now confirmed.
!!comment!!: I hear people had to work this afternoon‚Ä¶. 

That‚Äôs rough.
!!comment!!: I spend way too much time on here. Thag outage had me struggling
!!comment!!: Yeh, well I'm sick of it when I try to reply to a comment and it appears as its own comment half way up the daily üòë
!!comment!!: Anyone else chained to the fiat mines today and had no idea Reddit was down?  Boss man was extra heavy on the whips today üò≠
!!comment!!: I have terrible strep throat but all my coins going up is healing me
!!comment!!: It's finally payday! Which means DCA day has come again
!!comment!!: Just looked at my portfolio and thought something had suddenly caused it to drop by $5küò≥

I was looking at it in $USD instead of $AUD.
!!comment!!: LMFAAAAAOOOO someone just parked a van with a BTC Ad infront of Silicon Valley Bank
!!comment!!: The nice thing about holding XRP is you dont really dump much, cause you never pump.
!!comment!!: If CS is saved, btc and alts are gonna rip to the upside
!!comment!!: another day done in the fiat mines! hows your day going?
!!comment!!: You can't convince me eth isn't headed to 10k this next cycle

!!comment!!: Dear all

New Kahoot time  
We‚Äôve had to postpone Kahoot trivia 24 hours forward due to the Reddit outage - new time:  
6 pm EDT Wednesday 15 March 2023  
10 pm UTC Wednesday 15 March 2023   
9 am AEDT Thursday 16 March 2023 (for the Aussies)
!!comment!!: I was so bored without reddit
!!comment!!: Thought Reddit pulled a SVB
!!comment!!: I logged into the broken app and my vault wasn‚Äôt showing my Moons.  My heart dropped for a second üò≥
!!comment!!: Phew, I thought I was ban
!!comment!!: Everybody had a little jump when they didnt knew servers where down and saw cant view this community, atleast my heart dropped
!!comment!!: Well I didn't realize how much time I spend on Reddit until it was down and I had nothing to do. Missed you all ‚ù§Ô∏è
!!comment!!: I made spaghetti with mushroom and sweet sausage sauce, and donated Plasma for some cash. What did you do during the Great Reddit Outage of ‚Äò23?
!!comment!!: I feel left out. Didn‚Äôt even know Reddit was down.
!!comment!!: I just looked at the CCMoons Karma estimator and I don't think it's counting up the number of comments for today since the outage correctly. 

Did anyone else notice this?
!!comment!!: It turns out BTC was a bank failure hedge all alone.
!!comment!!: I can take big red days, but reddit going down? hell naw
!!comment!!: I don't think anyone here would fall for this (then again...) but just wanted to warn people that some users have been scammed by selling their Reddit avatars to other users who contacted them via DMs, who sent them Goerli testnet ETH, instead of mainnet ETH.

There was a post about it in the avatar trading sub, although I can't link it here.

Many of us have done successfully p2p  trades with one another through the DMs, but it's always a risk, especially if you don't know what you're doing, so general advice is to stick to OpenSea
!!comment!!: I survived the great Reddit crash of March 2023 by sleeping right through it
!!comment!!: Im slightly embarrassed to ask this, but what exactly does it mean when you hear the phrase ‚Äú$XX in ETH were burned‚Äù?
!!comment!!: The one time I have a comment going viral in a hot thread and of course Reddit crashes lol 

Me and crypto keep going at it
!!comment!!: Drinking a cup of Sakura green tea au fait at Doutor, Japan and counting my blessings this Reddit is working again so I can get my crypto news
!!comment!!: Good morning everyone üòä

Glad reddit is back üòÅ went to bed early last night because the site was down and I didn't have anything better to do lol
!!comment!!: This pump was nice, but I am still far from breaking even..
!!comment!!: Happy snapshot day! I‚Äôm quite excited as it‚Äôs my first one ü§ì Let‚Äôs hope the ratio won‚Äôt be too bad. What are you thinking?
!!comment!!: Guys I bought the dip. Garlic dip from the pizza shop
!!comment!!: what happening in the financial world
!!comment!!: It‚Äôs okay, we can‚Äôt pump every day. Took some profits and I‚Äôll be ready to put them back in
!!comment!!: Credit Suisse is sliding, but if you look at its performance over the past 3 years it's literally a shitcoin 

Down 80%+
!!comment!!: Btc is going to go up another 15% with all these banks failing
!!comment!!: Idk for you guys but for me Reddit isn't working very good today
!!comment!!: BTC is like the light in end of the tunel
!!comment!!: Why anyone would go long or short right now is beyond me.
!!comment!!: For the ones staking Eth at Coinbase.

https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1636047272357101569

>5/ If you‚Äôd like to unstake, Coinbase will begin taking unstaking requests about 24 hours after the upgrade completes. All unstaking requests are processed on-chain, and we‚Äôll pass the unstaked funds and staking rewards to you once released by the Ethereum protocol

Upgrade is in 1 month or so
!!comment!!: I say we take off and nuke the banks from orbit.
!!comment!!: For those with hardware wallets. Do you take advantage of the optional passphrase feature ? Why or why not
!!comment!!: It pains me to say it but this dump makes more sense to me. Crypto is still way to entangled with fiat banking.

!!comment!!: Finally everyone is realising that crypto is better than banks

!!comment!!: Naturally, I got 666 karma last distribution. Pleasantly surprised the ratio was still at least 0.7417 considering the increase in activity.
!!comment!!: We‚Äôre all addicted to Reddit confirmed.
!!comment!!: It was very rude for reddit to go down as we dropped to 24k. I wanted to panic with you guys.
!!comment!!: Is it snapshot day already again? 0.0
!!comment!!: Just to be clear, free money for poor people caused inflation so they had to make it impossible to borrow money and make sure a lot of us lost our jobs so we'd stop spending but then a bunch of billionaires grossly mismanaged their portfolios and the money printer is fired up immediately to make them whole. I have that right?
!!comment!!: Fun fact : Moons outperformed the S&P 500, NASDAQ, BTC and ETH, and every single bank stocks in the last 12 months.
!!comment!!: Credit Suisse about to go under
!!comment!!: Reddit‚Äôs finally working again. Woohoo
!!comment!!: Missed out on some moons with reddit down all day!

!!comment!!: What's the best way to store the seed phrase for your hardware wallet? Wrong answer only
!!comment!!: Finally we are back here my friends. Have been missing you all for a couple of hours.

!!comment!!: Swaps to BTC- *crashes*

Swaps to USDC- *depegs*

Swaps to USD- *rampant inflation*

Time to buy precious metals
!!comment!!: Coinbase:

"We are temporarily pausing USDC:USD conversions over the weekend while banks are closed. During periods of heightened activity, conversions rely on USD transfers from the banks that clear during normal banking hours. When banks open on Monday, we plan to re-commence conversions."

LOL
!!comment!!: Never thought I‚Äôd see USDC depeg, but here we are‚Ä¶
!!comment!!: Coinbase pauses conversion between USDC and USD for the weekend.
!!comment!!: I don't see the point of buying USDC at this levels. 

You risk your capital for a 10% possible upside. Literally buy anything else you'd have better risk/reward ratio.
!!comment!!: We are witnessing history guys.
!!comment!!: In completely unrelated news to what‚Äôs going on, a small update that I now display an image of your avatar whenever you search on https://ccmoons.com/estimator
!!comment!!: I've been through 3 full cycles and in my interpretation this is the most wild bear I've been through in totality, Ust, Gemini, voyager, Ftx,Usdc presumably, I know mT. Gox is the gold standard, and the hash wars,but this is getting real at a pace that's very confusing.Ehat too play what not too play?
!!comment!!: Bitcoin is back over $20k at least! Bull run confirmed üëç
!!comment!!: People not able to convert USDC to USD, and hence they are buying more crypto like BTC. We can see $22k BTC or even more if this continues.
!!comment!!: Probably shouldn't fight this feeling anymore

2. Coinbase suspends selling USDC
3. Selloff drains Curve pool
4. Binance suspends USDC to BUSD conversions
5. USDC @ \~ 0.92836 on Kucoin right now
!!comment!!: I pussied out and converted my USDC into EUR taking a 5% loss. I've already dodged the UST bullet converting UST to USDC last time, feels like they're coming after my money lol
!!comment!!: So tether is now the most trusted stable coin?! What the actual fuck lol
!!comment!!: If you have USDC, take the 10% loss now. Not worth the risk. I did the same with UST and watched it crashing to 2c after. Best decision ever.
!!comment!!: Word on the street is JPM is going to buy out svb. Chances are this will all blow over in a few days and give the fed the fear it needs to see things are finally breaking. 

Remind me 3 days!
!!comment!!: In the last 12 months,

- We survived LUNA.
- We survived 3 Arrows.
- We survived Celsius,BlockFi and Voyager.
- We survived FTX.
- We survived Genesis/DCG.
- We survived BUSD.
- We survived USDC.

We definitely deserve a bull market.
!!comment!!: What a crazy day for crypto. Geez crypto is wild west these days.
!!comment!!: Had 1k sitting in USDT, so I sold it and actually made $10 profit. Bull market confirmed. üòÇ

!!comment!!: The sub loved Algo - we all know what happened

The sub loved USDC - we all know what's happening

The sub hated USDT - üò∂

We live in a ruthless world for real.
!!comment!!: USDC/ USDT @ 0.96398 on Kucoin right now!
!!comment!!: Okay guys, I have to sleep but I'll let you guard the charts for me. I hope I don't wake up with a USDC collapse but I'll be cautiously optimistic and say that it'll repeg. Good night to all!
!!comment!!: Anybody else also watch the Luna collapse live?  This is very reminiscent.
!!comment!!: Hoping that my 0.9 USDC order gets filled

So I can make an easy 10% when it repegs to $1
!!comment!!: Coinbase pausing conversion is NOT a confident signal.
!!comment!!: Who else thinks this bank collapse will lead to more crypto adoption? I kinda anticipated this so far.
!!comment!!: For Canadians, Newton has stopped USDC buys and withdrawls
!!comment!!: USDC is depegging, this is not a drill
!!comment!!: Ok, I'm done. 6.30am seems like a good time to go to sleep. 

Let the world burn in peace!! Enjoy the shit storm boys, girls and hamsters! :)
!!comment!!: Are USDC refugees driving other crypto prices up?
!!comment!!: BlockFi had $227 million in now-collapsed Silicon Valley Bank left there after it filled for bankruptcy? Stop stop he‚Äôs already dead üò≠
!!comment!!: I just sold 85% of my portfolio in the last 5 minutes.  I am not going to risk this.
!!comment!!: When the sub hated usdt and loved usdc , I should have known.
!!comment!!: Despite USDC sales being blocked, I was able to use my Coinbase card and purchase an amazon gift card for the remaining USDC balance that I had left in my account.  Not the most elegant solution...but it will do!
!!comment!!: Are you as stressed as me? Cause im sweating bullet sover here staring at the USDC chart. Im going to help out:

!!comment!!: I think the dump might occur once USDC stops depegging.  Because continuous demegging means USDC -> BTC.  The whales will wait for USDC to stabilize before taking down the entire market.
!!comment!!: My prediction. 

&#x200B;

1.  Some time this weekend, USDC will move back up to like 90-95 cents level. 
2. BTC will go up and carry the alts when this happens, and everyone will be euphoric. 
3. At that point, Bitcoin will dump hard to 18-19K.
!!comment!!: Honestly, I‚Äôm not even gonna worry about it. I‚Äôm just gonna go to sleep and I‚Äôm sure *everything* will be fine by the morning. 

Or a total shit show but either way can‚Äôt stress over what I can‚Äôt control I guess.
!!comment!!: Be careful.  You have hundred of millions of dollars of BTC that was forced into BTC from USDC right now.  The whales are probably going to look to sell.
!!comment!!: Moons a re up though lol. I think theyre becoming one of the safest options out there to hold cash in üòÜ
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Idk why everyone is so worried? This is the most centralized part of crypto failing. I call this a win for decentralization.
!!comment!!: Man I have a bad feeling‚Ä¶ SBF was just the beginning
!!comment!!: We are experiencing the rare quintuple of getting fucked.

Inflation gets your savings

Rates ruin your stocks

Banks ruin your crypto

And all this FUD ruins the Karma/Moon ratio for this month.

And I‚Äôm here to ruin your day.

So yes quintuple fucked.
!!comment!!: Also, the market reaction to the usdc depeg is very weak. Maybe cause its the weekend?
!!comment!!: I'm glad I picked the only true stable coin: Cardano
!!comment!!: WTF is going on with the USDC chart????
!!comment!!: This is weird. I thought Coinbase showed proof of reserves and full backing of USDC?

Wtf is going on.
!!comment!!: USDC isn't the only one depegging right now. DAI, PAX, GUSD are also not at 1.00.
!!comment!!: Here's a quote that aged like milk:

"However, it's important to note that the likelihood of a USDC depeg is relatively low, as it is backed by a significant amount of reserves and is considered to be one of the more reliable stablecoins in the market."
!!comment!!: So there is a good chance that BTC will moon on Monday because lot of people will sell their stable coins and buying BTC
!!comment!!: Look, just buy as much Bitcoin as you can and you'll be fine. See? Crypto is actually very simple.
!!comment!!: The degenerates will be slaughtered to the last one.

The curious will flee under the terror.

The faithful will be tested again and again.

The knowledgeable will bathe in blood.

Stack Bitcoin. üëë
!!comment!!: Maybe I'm just speaking too soon but all things considered things look... Fine?

This is pretty much what my "apocalypse black swan" event looked like in my head, at least it looked something like this.
!!comment!!: well dca day today ! ready 2 buy some extra eth love.it

!!comment!!: anyone else got that eerie feeling that shit is gonna hit the fan this summer?

!!comment!!: Probably still early but well done to those who braved the dip. Hope we get more green days... ü§ë

Until JPowell's shitshow spoils things again. ü§ê
!!comment!!: I know I stay forever bullish on BTC, which I should be practical & realize that may not always be the case BUT‚Ä¶

I do feel like with current events that are transpiring, people are slowly losing faith in the traditional financial system & will start accumulating precious metals & crypto.

2 co-workers signed up to Coinbase today & bought their first BTC
!!comment!!: Everything gonna be alright guys. Stick to the game plan.
!!comment!!: BTC is the only true and real stable coin. Stop chasing all USD forked coins..
!!comment!!: Maybe we should all chip in and buy Coingecko a new server. It can‚Äôt handle the slighest bit of excitement.
!!comment!!: Picking the right time to buy the dip

!!comment!!: Nice! I went out for 4 hours and BTC to 20.5k and Moons to 22c. 

Should I go back out again?
!!comment!!: I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to go to sleep with shorts and wake up to massive profits and it won‚Äôt even matter because the exchange I‚Äôm using will have stopped withdrawals
!!comment!!: Imagine being in a part of the world just waking up right now to see USDC depegging and not knowing the back story?
!!comment!!: Floor on The Eyes is steadily rising.  


Maybe I'll consider listing my duplicate in a while.
!!comment!!: üëÄ Watching the USDC / USDT pair drop like a rock. Usually I only see my alts go down like this.
!!comment!!: Another weekend with people doing TA on stable coins. *Fun times in crypto!*
!!comment!!: Exit USDC gonna drive up crypto prices just like exit from MTGOX drive up BTC in 2011.  History rhymes.
!!comment!!: Man if btc drops to $10k, I‚Äôm mortgaging my house to go all in
!!comment!!: $3.3 billion out of $40 billion of USDC reserves stuck in Silicon Valley Bank is not good but thankfully not horrific, since SVB still has a ton of assets to cover major clients. I assume Circle (USDC)  will take a 3-4% hit in their reserves *at worst*? Unless something goes horribly wrong with the strategy to liquidate assets, which obviously is always a possibility.

!!comment!!: 2022 was the bear. 2023 is looking like the crab. What more TA do you need (with the addition of the impending halving) to see that 2024 is probably the bull year. Im predicting it starts somewhat early, though. Like halfway through this year the crab starts getting all spikey and grows a little oxtail. Might get its nose pierced if its feeling cute IDK.
!!comment!!: Geez...credit card, auto, and mortgage defaults are piling up. And BRICS nations are edge closer to their own currency. Markets look ripe to crash this month...will crypto be a good hedge, or will it tumble and fall?
!!comment!!: I mined fiat for 15 hours today and I still haven‚Äôt left work. Can‚Äôt wait to sell this shit for some crypto.

!!comment!!: Some of the shit in this sub feels like you are browsing r/safemoon sometimes. It's brain rotting.
!!comment!!: 4-hr charts look nasty. Like Requiem For a Dream nasty.
!!comment!!: Daily reminder to always double check the address you're sending into even if you copy pasted the address. I just got scammed for $700 from clipboard malware. Silly me, should've double check.. Well, Shit happens I guess

!!comment!!: Anybody else from a 3rd world/ developing country here ?
!!comment!!: Got a sick pump in the gym to compensate for the lack of pumps in the market.
!!comment!!: Am I the only one who sees all this as an opportunity to buy cheap?  Many here lament that they missed the opportunity to buy cheap.  Now is their chance.
!!comment!!: Does anyone else remember getting gifted 1k+ moons by some random redditor here just for posting on the daily back in April 2022?

I miss that guy. I hope he's doing well with his fat bag of moons.
!!comment!!: I never liked having money anyways...
!!comment!!: I'm fantasizing about having sold my entire bag at 25k and being able to buy lower now. Anyone else?
!!comment!!: Going to Goblin town soon‚Ä¶

!!comment!!: When market goes up, I feel I haven't invested enough.

When it goes down, it feels I've overinvested.

I need to break out of this psychology, torturing myself for no reason.
!!comment!!: I told myself when my crypto holdings got to a certain level, I‚Äôd switch to a Ledger for protection.    I was very close.  Looks like I don‚Äôt have to worry about that now.
!!comment!!: Rsi on 4 hour chart reaching the 8 November Ftx crash lows. Panic much

!!comment!!: In all fairness, I‚Äôve become numb to this market movement.
!!comment!!: Who the hell hit the nuke button
!!comment!!: The fact we got spoiled in January makes these dips hurt a little extra
!!comment!!: High ass inflAtion, hawkish fed, dumbass politicians hating on crypto.. warning signs were all there but I ignored them all for hopium ü•π
!!comment!!: Stocks are getting rocked too guys; there‚Äôs definitely correlation today
!!comment!!: Ouch. Waking up to this I should just go back to bed.

!!comment!!: The more we go down now the more I believe we'll make life changing money in 2025

!!comment!!: Rip Bullrun
February 2023 - February 2023
!!comment!!: Bitcoin is still going to the moon‚Ä¶but just drilling it‚Äôs way deep down into the Earth and then popping out the other side before getting there
!!comment!!: Who knew that 2020 and 2021 would be the most corrupt,  mismanaged and poorly executed bull run ever recorded for crypto? It'll be years before any of these fake leveraged gains are reached to break even if you bought in 2021 especially.  Literally every day some crypto company's like I actually lied we don't have a sustainable business.  
 
Domino effect of degen.
!!comment!!: Wow, a freefall. No bounce even a small one.
!!comment!!: I feel sorry for everyone that hasn‚Äôt discovered crypto yet. It must suck to get a full nights rest.
!!comment!!: Well boys time to embrace BTC being under 20k again

Hold strong‚úä
!!comment!!: We are back to the 2017 btc ATH

That was a strange 5 years to say the least
!!comment!!: Feels like 2022 starting all over again.
!!comment!!: The ol' joke of I'm gonna make wife changing money in crypto, well yeah ... She's gone, took the Nissan Micra with her and here I am holding coins named after dogs and turtles.
!!comment!!: Well at least I'm earning 1 moon a day for providing liquidity.

!!comment!!: FIGHTING FOR MY FUCKJNG LIFE LETS GO
!!comment!!: USA tried to destroy crypto focused banks and ended up ruining their own banks.
!!comment!!: OK, but on a real note.  SVB going under will likely hurt BtC short term.  But this has to be bullish for BtC and crypto long term?  Record high inflation, bank runs, etc.  Isn‚Äôt this what we‚Äôve all been preparing for?
!!comment!!: Future me is either going to be wearing 1 sock and drinking cold soup straight from a can... Or I'll be shitposting from my Yacht and giving out snek awards

!!comment!!: Is it safe to check chart now? üò¨
!!comment!!: A year ago I would‚Äôve been scared to death and sold

A couple months ago I would‚Äôve thrown a large amount at the dip with an anxious smile and check the charts hourly

Now I set up some weekly DCAs and my soul is at peace.
!!comment!!: I'm thinking we bounce after the higher unemployment rate.
!!comment!!: Started with $200 at beginning of 2020. Flipped, traded and  had 44k in my portfolio oct 2021 during the bull run. watched it all go down slowly after and now fully liquidated. Learnt my lesson and ready to buy in slowly now and wait for next run.
!!comment!!: Nothing like a dippy dip on my day of birth üéÇ
!!comment!!: got a feeling we are about to dip even further
!!comment!!: You guys ever think about how crazy it is that we discuss prices going up and down daily without our control? It‚Äôs like having a daily thread for the weather and freaking out about a sunny day.
!!comment!!: When BTC almost hit $20k in 2017 it was 76k Lira.  
When BTC bounces around $20k in 2023 it is 379k Lira.  
5X in a little over 5 years.  
Do you think Turkish people are whining about this drop as much as us?
!!comment!!: If it makes anyone feel better I bought crypto for the first time in months like 5 minutes before BTC shit the bed.
!!comment!!: People calling BTC under 10k, Buttcoiners having a great time. Stay strong.
!!comment!!: BTC going to 30K in the next week!
!!comment!!: Why did I invest 100% of my cash at 22k thinking that was a nice pull back to enter

!!comment!!: There she goes under $20k ü´° was a pleasure sirs
!!comment!!: I know the charts may be depressing so I am going to lighten the mood with another Snek giveaway. Name a coin you think is too overvalued, even right now.

While supplies last
!!comment!!: Not many people would be able to handle this kind of volatility. All of us still on this roller coaster are something else - degens or geniuses, time will tell.
!!comment!!: Crackin a cold one for you boys
!!comment!!: *sighs* opens wallet and buys more
!!comment!!: Who's holding while everything is dipping? üôãüôãüôã
!!comment!!: Oh boy there could be a bull run coming‚Ä¶.aannnnd it‚Äôs gone
!!comment!!: You have $5k to spend , what are you buying?
!!comment!!: In the end, it doesn‚Äôt even matter.
!!comment!!: Remember guys, the pain of a bear market doesn‚Äôt come close to the pain of not having your bags packed in a bull market. This is the way. You know what you have to do. Now smile. SMILE!!
!!comment!!: Spent half of my spare fiat earlier. Hardly surprising to find out now then that that wasn't the bottom -- but that's precisely why I still have the other half on hold.

Can't time the market!
!!comment!!: I know long term is fine but damn, the daily charts of BTC is depressing. 

Oh and all the other ones too.
!!comment!!: I‚Äôve been growing chillies for some time now, from seed. And I‚Äôm finally starting to see some chillies growing. 

Im so happy! I know it‚Äôs not crypto related at all. But I thought I‚Äôd share it
!!comment!!: Markets were shit today but at least I got to talk to the cute girl at my gym today
!!comment!!: So when moon distribution happens there's the general ratio for everybody based on how active the sub was and then there's that CCIP 030 Karma Multiplier based on if the person retained their moons or sold more than 25%. Am I effected by both these ratios at the same time? Say a user has a KM of 0.30 because he sold and then the subreddit ratio is 0.80. How are both applied?
!!comment!!: Last day of school this term. Slogged it out as the emcee for Awards Day ceremony. Finished everything on my to-do list. Ushering in the holidays n Will shitpost my hardest next week!

!!comment!!: I've seen my portfolio down to -90%. This is nothing. Give me pain. I'll take that pain anyday.
!!comment!!: 18k BTC looking inevitable at this point. Maybe a further collapse back to the recent lows of 15k. Depressing.
!!comment!!: Crypto roads take me home...
!!comment!!: I'm hearing the market is down a bit, Thankfully I've made some smart decisions and only bought into blue chip tokens, BTC and ETH. Let me check how my investment is doiAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
!!comment!!: Let me tell you something about the Titanic

People forget that on the Titanic's maiden voyage there were over 1000 miles of uneventful, very pleasurable cruising before it hit the iceberg.
!!comment!!: Another day

Another DCA

DCA bros stay strong!!!
!!comment!!: I literally caught a falling knife yesterday. Chefs knife I received as a gift, hand forged in Japan and purchased from the smith in Japan. If it hit the floor from the drop off the counter it would have snapped.

Without a thought I grabbed it in free-fall on the spine, 50/50 chance you don't get stitches.
!!comment!!: Rip bull run 3-10-23 6:00 AM - 6:10 AM
!!comment!!: BTC sub 19K today without question
!!comment!!: I managed to earn 4$ with my 20x leverage long. This is after getting my 50$ liquidated yesterday. Follow me for day trading tips.
!!comment!!: U.S. bank regulators seize Silicon Valley Bank in largest bank failure since the Great Recession ‚Äî

And people still ask are we heading into a recession..WAKE UP we are already  in one.
!!comment!!: So Silicon Valley Bank has offically been shut down by regulators and the FDIC will protect anyone's deposits by up to $250,000.  The problem is, I'm sure many of the start ups had way more than $250,000 in their SVB account.

Just a factual reminder to never trust the Banks, Government, Regulators, etc. HODL Bitcoin and a few choice ALTs off chain, and you can completely escape this madness.
!!comment!!: Got to love these tests of patience during the bear market.

When you set your expectations to a drop down to $3k BTC then you'll find these small dips to be less remarkable.
!!comment!!: I love how in the bear market I can spot individual names and might find them in other posts or other dailies. It‚Äôs really cool having this integrated community. I am going to miss the bear market. When the bull market starts all the bots and delusional investors pour back into r/cc
!!comment!!: A dip and my payday coinciding?? üò±

!!comment!!: Just want to give a big virtual hug to all my algorand people who lost coins to the hack ü•∫

Opsec is critically overlooked and misunderstood in this space.

You‚Äôre only as safe as your last transaction.

You‚Äôre never truly safe in ANY hot wallet.

You‚Äôre only safe in a cold wallet if you don‚Äôt sign fraudulent transactions.

I have 3 types of addresses for each of my coins on my ledger.

Hot: Receive coins from CEXs to this address first. Connect it to risky DEXs, sign nft signatures, will post this address publicly, etc. Keep the balance low.

Lukewarm: Send coins from hot address to this one. It‚Äôs connected to sushi, opensea, metamask, uniswap. All the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù dexs and protocols.

Cold: only receives from lukewarm wallet. Never interacts with anything. Never signs anything. Coins just sit there until it‚Äôs time to move them out in the bull run.

Edit: as for the hack. Sometimes‚Ä¶ the coins are just gone.. There‚Äôs risk with everything in crypto. Self custody (or multi sig) in a fresh wallet is the best chance you have at ‚Äúsafety‚Äù but some things are out of your control.

!!comment!!: \*Checks Wallet\*  


Meh.... maybe tomorrow.
!!comment!!: *Decimate* is based on the Latin word for the number ten. The ancient Romans dealt with mutiny or cowardice in the army by selecting one man in ten, chosen by lot, for punishment, which normally meant death. 

Which crypto out of ten cryptocurrencies would be the first to be decimated in your opinion?
!!comment!!: The longer you are in invested in crypto, the more you move towards BTC.
!!comment!!: I got a good amount of my favorite alts the last few months. Now it‚Äôs time to focus on ETH & the stock market to add more stability to the portfolio
!!comment!!: Sigh. Algo see myself out.
!!comment!!: I‚Äôm just HODLing onto my losses at this point. Don‚Äôt start your crypto journey during a bull run kids. Wait for times like these.
!!comment!!: This week marks the 11th anniversary since I was first introduced to Bitcoin. It was a coworker who tried to convince me to invest in Bitcoin back then and suggested that I should invest around 5,000 NOK, which was equivalent to around 850 USD at the time.
Or 150+ BTC‚Ä¶

I laughed him off, and didn't see the potential in Bitcoin at the time. After all, back in 2012 Bitcoin was still in its infancy, and very few people had heard of it. It was hard to imagine that a digital currency could have any real-world value or use.

Yeah.. that‚Äôs a story for the grandkids.. #legend
!!comment!!: BUSD MCap down to $8.4 billion.  


Crazy to think it was double that just a few weeks ago.
!!comment!!: Grayscale had their initial oral arguments today vs the SEC, after suing the SEC for rejecting Grayscale's spot BTC ETF.

The judges on the US Court of Appeals were grilling the SEC who seemed on the defensive the whole time. The judges questioned how the SEC could approve the Futures ETF, but not approve the Spot BTC ETF - which rely on the same data.

Looks very favorable for GBTC.
!!comment!!: In 08 I was like 14 watching the world crumble. I was so mad the bankers could
Get away with being so irresponsible and then shorting it the whole way down.

A few years later trolling through 4chan I heard of this thing called bitcoin. It was the ultimate fuck you to the banks and government. I did some research, and it was so cyberpunk I loved it. I needed to get in. 

After spending a few hours trying to figure out how to buy and where to store, I decided it was too complicated and not worth it. This was like 2010-2011. It was around a dollar then. Now I slap myself when I have to go to work these days
!!comment!!: The most bullish potential news.

 A judge overturning the Greyscale decision thereby approving a spot BTC ETF.

And 

Ripple vs SEC win at summary judgement
!!comment!!: Can I pay a Reddit NFT avatar with reddit coins or "only ca$h"?

People compare Bitcoin to tulip mania‚Ä¶I can name a million reasons why there is zero comparison, but let‚Äôs just look at time frame alone‚Ä¶Tulip mania bubble lasted from 1634-1637.

That‚Äôs 3 years‚Ä¶let‚Äôs even make it 6 years, since the average life span has pretty much doubled since those times‚Ä¶BTC has still been rolling for over doubled that time span.

!!comment!!: Look everyone asking for green and bull market!

Ask yourself the question if you have accumulated enough? If not, you will also be the guy buying at the higher prices trying to chase a higher profit.

Me I am nowhere near the amount I wanted to buy, so I honestly hope for 1 more year of bear to buy.

That way I can be ready for the bull market and ride it out. 

Now is the time money is made, not when the bull market starts.

!!comment!!: It always feels bad when you don't take profits at certain price point because you think it'll keep going up, but at the same time, you can't blame yourself for not knowing it'll dump after reaching that price point. What matters is that you keep yourself invested in the projects you believe in and just keep accumulating until the time is right.

Keep DCA-ing and HODL-ing. Don't mind the present noise. Extend and widen your time-frame and you'll be thankful you did so. Have a great day, y'all!

!!comment!!: Something in another thread got me interested and I started looking up info on the stock market in the 1920‚Äôs. There was no crypto then, so I wondered what was considered new and shiny. 

I happened upon this analysis and it‚Äôs long and boring and probably no one wants to read it, but it discusses the ways in which innovation contribute to the stock market.  If you feel like reading a 45(!) page discussion (or falling asleep to one) here‚Äôs the link:

https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/stocksinnovation_a7c774bc-c552-450d-b0f4-a5eb04634d9c.pdf

If you want to search it, the title is: Stock Market Swings and the Value of Innovation, 1908-1929

It‚Äôs on the Harvard website.

Posting it here because crypto is innovative and new, and some people here are also into the stocks and whatnot.

He relocated down to Australia just over ten years ago but one of his last parties or events he went to before leaving New York had a small Bitcoin sponsor and when you entered the building they gave everyone a usb with like 100 free Bitcoin on it. He said when he was leaving at the end of the night the whole floor was just littered with USBs. He said he now feels so stupid for not keeping his and throwing it away.

!!comment!!: Thought this is interesting- If you look at the whales‚Äô account, they‚Äôre not accumulating now. They‚Äôre selling. One of the top wallets this subreddit mentions every now and then last bought their bitcoin back in November. They have been selling it since then, and have yet to buy a significant amount. 

They‚Äôre loading their fiat for something.

[The wallet I was referring to.](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1LQoWist8KkaUXSPKZHNvEyfrEkPHzSsCd) It is assumed that this wallet is connected to a few more (2-3).

If it does happen, it'll be good for prices in the next bull run, but also sad at the same time if gambling with shitcoins is seen as the only way to move forward financially.
!!comment!!: Not financial advise: buy btc let the whales cry
!!comment!!: What are some deleterious effects of crypto on your life?
!!comment!!: A slug , a snail and a crab "walk" into a  bar.
!!comment!!: Cannot believe we don't have 29 feb

!!comment!!: Honestly, another chance at buying sub 20k Bitcoin and I'd be all over it. I've not bought as heavily this year but am still buying regularly regardless. 

Do we think now we've seen 25k (only just) there's a little more faith in the market and sub 20k is seen as a good opportunity once again?
!!comment!!: Is here anyone who just wanna see BTC at $100k and sell it. Just wanna buy a small house and Live a peaceful life with your family?

!!comment!!: I honestly believe $16500 is the Bitcoin bottom‚Ä¶I think the collapse of FTX pushed us to the bottom. I don‚Äôt see rates or any macroeconomics taking us below that‚Ä¶even the SEC has declared that BTC is not a security.

Keep in mind that I know nothing lol

What other 2 should I take and why?

!!comment!!: Coinbase Cloud's MATIC validator stopped signing checkpoints for \~8 hours last night and is at risk of forced unstake.

[https://staking.polygon.technology/validators/142](https://staking.polygon.technology/validators/142)

**228,832,851.43 MATIC** is locked up to this validator and could potentially be unstaked in the near future. This is one of the top 10 Validators on the MATIC network. It is important to note that that vast majority of this staked MATIC is staked by less than 10 wallets, however. 

Over 100 million MATIC is staked by 3 addresses alone. I don't expect this to have a negative price impact as these stakers are very likely to just move their stakes.

!!comment!!: So burnt out from the week

Almost there

C'mon market do something good
!!comment!!: So many rugs, so few magic carpets
!!comment!!: These are not the charts you're looking for
!!comment!!: Fuck these charts, it‚Äôs Friday my dudes. Take yourself for a walk around the block, turn on some music, dim the lights, and touch yourself.
!!comment!!: Does commenting or posting give you more moons?
!!comment!!: I must confess I'm really dissapointed with the price action of Algorand lately.

I mean, when (if ever) will the hurting stop?

!!comment!!: just to be clear:  gdp is down, inflation continues to remain \~5% (much above the 2% goal of the FED) and the job market continues to stay stubbornly strong.  there's definitely no reason to panic, but wall street will certainly pull back for at least a week or two before forgetting all of this and getting all pumped up again.

!!comment!!: Happy Friday all, the charts are red but the beers are cold!
!!comment!!: The 2024 Bitcoin halving will be the most important Halving of all time. Bitcoin is about to become the hardest asset in the world with certainty. The inflation rate of Bitcoin will drop to half gold's, overtaking gold as the best store of value in the world. A big turning point.

!!comment!!: Before Artificial Intelligence should we expect Artificial Dumbness? Imagine an "AI" with an extreme Dunning-Kruger complex, who mistakenly thinks they are super intelligent, who wont listen to reason and who accelerates the end of humanity by making wrong conclusions from information at hand.

Couple that with the Roko's basilisk thought experiment which  states that an otherwise benevolent artificial superintelligence in the future would be incentivized to create a virtual reality simulation to torture anyone who knew of its potential existence but did not directly contribute to its advancement or development. Sounds grim.

Anyway, how is everyone's morning?

!!comment!!: Question for the Matic holders here; arent you a bit disappointed that all these big partnerships Matic is having (Meta, Adidas, Disney, Nike, Reddit, Robinhood, and Starbucks.) are mostly just NFT partnerships?
!!comment!!: Uhh got about 400 moons this time around. The data said I had 198 karma. I mean I‚Äôll take it!

!!comment!!: Happy Tuesday from Vietnam brothers!!! Hope tomorrow it will pump
!!comment!!: Hey guys, I feel like I should know this, but I don‚Äôt and could use a little help.    Is there a way to mix btc that is legal and kyc compliant?   Just to hide wallet info from your recipient?
!!comment!!: Someone is accumulating right now
!!comment!!: Well I asked for volatility and I got volatility.

I regret asking

Simply invest whenever I am not. Stonks.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: I am a degen, but not in the sense you probably are thinking. I am one of those who likes to watch the BTC 1 min chart even though I have a long-term (~10 years) investing plan.
!!comment!!: Another miserable day at the fiat mine..
!!comment!!: Woho  didnt expect to get that much Moons. Thank you Mr. Moon

!!comment!!: Top karma earner has received 20k moons this round
!!comment!!: So quite a while back the screen on my phone broke, ended up buying a new phone.

I had a few hundred moons. Thought ok no problem. I can get back in to my Vault. Somehow, no idea how, the seed phrase never worked.

Had to create a new one. There's nothing I can do about it I guess.

If the screen was repaired, and I were to log in to Reddit. Would it be tied to the same Vault?
!!comment!!: That moon ratio is insane. Really regret not commenting more
!!comment!!: Who else feels like if this is the bear market , we‚Äôre going to be legend?
!!comment!!: It's almost like moon christmas+moon birthday today

!!comment!!: Wow my portfolio has quickly recovered!üí™ let‚Äôs get it
!!comment!!: Good morning. Dont mind the red. Will be green soon!
!!comment!!: Not sure if I have upset someone but I can see a heap of my comments have been ‚¨áÔ∏è where others in the threads haven‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt see a reason but hey it‚Äôs probably a good sign for me to sign out for a while. 

Has been crap stuck home for weeks on end with a leg fracture but I can put weight on it as of yesterday - so should probably be doing something more productive with my time anyway. 

May the charts be ever in your favour üíö

!!comment!!: Hopefully my moon count will not be zero tomorrow ü§£
!!comment!!: I know we joke about it, but at this point in the cycle nobody should really be selling your positions. Been around a long time, and this year and the next you should really just be building your stack at this point. 

We will very very VERY likely have a big correction at some point and go much lower than we are today, because thats just how things usually work; but it wont matter in the end. As long as you keep adding to your positions via DCA over 23 and 24, you will be fine when the core of the next bull market takes off. (I suspect it will be later than we expect, we will see, but Im not expecting it to just rocket off right at the halving this time).
!!comment!!: Damnit! At this point it feels like we are a kid at the beach slowly building a sand castle, only to have a random teenager kick it down every time.
!!comment!!: One year ago was a very busy day here, with people capitulating at 33 with the first russian bombs only to see a rally to 45. Other bear rally filled by fomo and rocket emojis.

Time for all [the "China coins" to take off](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fpb3c90X0AMjOXx?format=jpg&name=large). Some of them already did so, like Neo and FIL.

!!comment!!: Moons down 12% within 30 mins
!!comment!!: Finally I can see comments again. It‚Äôs been a long 25 minutes
!!comment!!: Don't ya love it when your favorite s***coin is such a low cap it doesn't trade along with BTC. Everything else dumps with it. But your tiny s***coin doesn't budge.  Just watches them dump.
!!comment!!: Thank you!! I was on hiatus during the first two Gens, here's hoping!
!!comment!!: Genuinely what do you think you could achieve if you spent as much time dedicated to it as you do watching charts and shitposting on Reddit?

I know I could get in much better shape if I spent this much time running and lifting
!!comment!!: It feels good going to sleep in Europe when you know tomorrow is a moon distribution. Feels almost better than a pay day for some reason.
!!comment!!: I legitimately have not looked at my portfolio value in over a year now. I‚Äôve been auto-buying $10 of BTC every day to average down, but I actually have no idea how much I have right now in that + other crypto and stocks. Once the bull run kicks off I‚Äôm gonna take a peak and treat it like a Christmas gift lmao
!!comment!!: When I first made my large research post on matic for this sub she was trading at 29 cents, at the beginning of the bull market. Peaked at 10x that, made my first big bag of profit with matic so it will always hold a place near and dear to my heart. Of course I lost all my profits on other coins but still.
!!comment!!: Currently my portfolio is 70% ETH and 30% BTC. For my DCA going forward should I just go with BTC till I get closer to 50/50?
!!comment!!: Does Coinbase log you out every month or something or it just happens to me?
!!comment!!: I can't even recall the last time I saw anyone mention ANKR since 2021

Grats to anyone that actually had it in their bag!
!!comment!!: Did Reddit stop working for anyone else or was that just me?
!!comment!!: This sub is wild. You get a post that is super informative from an OG in the space. News articles from the premier sources on crypto. And copypasta/low effort content from crayon eaters.   


Your entire perception of crypto could vary depending on the time of day you visit
!!comment!!: I liked every post in here. It took me about two hours. My heart is racing and my thumb is aching. Still worth it.

!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: Crypto is so weird like it can just pump randomly then crab for ages then drop then crab for ages then pump massively and crab again. I love the volatility but it doesn't feel like it actually makes much sense
!!comment!!: CRO just pumped 15% in what, 2 hours? Im holding some but still very weird to see a sudden pump like that.

!!comment!!: BTC fees in last 24 hours = 32.7 BTC.

ETH fees = 4251 ETH = ~ 293 BTC

And ironically, which chain is it that is really dependent on fees for security?

Oh and in ETH, these fees get burnt permanently from the supply. That's how eth has developed a trend of negative inflation off late. This is true power of 'usage' rather than 'Walmart uses Vechain' type memes.
!!comment!!: Down only 10% all time on BTC after today, and we aren‚Äôt even in a full bull market. DCA and pray
!!comment!!: https://configurator.lamborghini.com/

!!comment!!: Just shorters at 25k, they will be eaten soon
!!comment!!: If I told you eth would be back at 1720 a month ago y‚Äôall would have laughed me off
!!comment!!: Why am I in the green:
1. Made a plan and killed my emotions with DCA

!!comment!!: anyone know why ckb paampin ?
!!comment!!: I got an early access to Fidelity Crypto. They only have and custody BTC and ETH. I have no reason to use it yet, but if they eventually have the ability to put crypto in a ROTH IRA with no tax on withdrawal that would be a game changer.

!!comment!!: The best thing about crypto for me is it has made me more financially aware. The amount of shit I used to waste money on and not think was ridiculous.

I've made money since I got into crypto but I've made far more by changing spending habits.
!!comment!!: Imagine going out on a Saturday night instead of sitting home alone shit posting about crypto and farming moons.
!!comment!!: VET only -89% down from ATH. Lets fucking go
!!comment!!: Let the party begin, see if we hold 25k this time around.
!!comment!!: BTC is still at a great accumulation price.
!!comment!!: Anyone buying the moons dip?
!!comment!!: A Vechain pump has appeared, one of the rarest occurrences.
!!comment!!: VET is pumping slightly, that can only mean BTC will dump soon
!!comment!!: Unrelated to crypto but I just feel the need to get it off my chest. 

Just been into a public toilet and got followed in by a few guys who I‚Äôm presuming were on drugs and were going in there to take more. Came in screaming, kicking the doors and generally being dickheads. Then I came out from the quickest piss of my life and they start shouting abuse at me, felt like they wanted a fight tbh. Like wtf is wrong with some people?

On the one hand I wanted to say something back to them but on the other I didn‚Äôt fancy fighting 3/4 druggies who probably carry knives (UK) I‚Äôm definitely no Tyson fury either lol

Then on the way out some poor old guy is going in and I gave him a heads up, he went in anyway. I sure hope he is okay. 

I fucking pray crypto gives me enough money to move to a remote place and avoid this kind of shit

!!comment!!: If history repeats itself, we are in the ‚Äú2019‚Äù part of the cycle. We‚Äôll have ups and downs but the bottom is in. Happy accumulating.
!!comment!!: stop it, i can only get so VET
!!comment!!: Its finally happening guys. VET is getting listed on Thursday!!!
!!comment!!: Anybody else holding back on buying more as the prices go up? I've only been in the game a little over a year. So I'm used to prices going down. It seems counterintuitive to buy when they're on an upward trend. But I'm not sure if that's just because I've never experienced a bull market.
!!comment!!: Fun fact guys do you know Vitalik Buterin was just 19 years old when he wrote the ETH whitepaper.

!!comment!!: You said throw your whole tax return into crypto??
!!comment!!: If we rip through 25k on a sunday evening daaamn
!!comment!!: Bruh I'm up 25% for the whole year and only 4.3% down overall. I started in Nov 21 bought everything at ATH's, I DCA and accumulated cash back in crypto all last year, surreal to see it pay off. Next bull run is all GREEN for me.

!!comment!!: dot reacted very well these two days.
!!comment!!: If we close past 25k I'm going to make very reasonable financial decisions.
!!comment!!: Get rekt shorts !!!! Hahahaha
!!comment!!: I don't get all these people claiming this pump is fake because it's allegedly people dumping their BUSD for BTC. I mean, who GAF what the reason for the pump is? Price is still going up, shorts are getting rekt, and bears are looking like numpties.
!!comment!!: I guess it's a party than!

!!comment!!: The most funny thing I heard today. Is about mark lol. He noticed that people are really obsessed with their social media‚Äôs accounts‚Ä¶ so he tried to suggest same services as elon musk did with twitter‚Äôs accounts. Wyt guys!? Would you pay for that !?
!!comment!!: Good evening! How is everyone feeling today?
!!comment!!: Alright folks that's enough for me tonight, but that charts aren't gonna watch themselves so if someone could keep an eye on them for me I'd appreciate it

!!comment!!: So... are nice low Matic fees "the good old days" now? I didn't anticipate this.
!!comment!!: I'm still expecting a big drop this year before the bull run.

I'm DCAing but if we hit all time lows I think I'm going to ape in.
!!comment!!: MATIC to jump ADA by the end of the day?
!!comment!!: Another Sunday another crab day, I hope there will be  more good news next week

!!comment!!: Anyone know where I can custom design a suit with a bunch of moon logos on it? I want to go to some meetings and conferences... lol
!!comment!!: There's no real way to stop staking on a decentralized, permissionless Dex. Unless the SEC gets the people running the front ends for those Dexes to agree to block use of their websites for US IP addresses (in which case US residents just use a VPN).

CEXes are another story. They've always been the weak point for crypto. They're where you turn fiat into crypto and crypto back into fiat in your bank account. We don't like them, but we need them if we're ever going to make money selling. And we need them every time we want to buy more using our fiat. And the CEXes will jump through whatever government hoops needed to stay in business,

You know, Craig, you can easily prove you are Satoshi by moving some of Satoshi‚Äôs coins in a transaction you announced beforehand. 

But you can‚Äôt do that, can you Craig? Because you aren‚Äôt Satishi, are you Craig? Can you fuck off now, Craig?
!!comment!!: Finally got my nano s plus. Not your keys not your crypto
!!comment!!: Is this Kraken news real or fud

They are stopping all staking 

https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1623767312116449281?t=iJlRqYuen6msfgKGRecjhQ&s=19
!!comment!!: Fingers crossed the SEC announcement will just be another Bitzlato-level statement.
!!comment!!: Kraken will automatically unstake all U.S. client assets enrolled in the on-chain staking program. These assets will no longer earn staking rewards. This applies to all staked assets except for staked ether (ETH), which will be unstaked after the Shanghai upgrade. U.S. clients will not be able to stake any additional assets, including ETH.

Kraken will continue to offer staking services for non-U.S. clients through a separate Kraken subsidiary.
!!comment!!: Me, a European: staking untouched and the price dips? Fuck yeah, loading up.
!!comment!!: I'm glad that the SEC is protecting me from Kraken while doing nothing to get my money back from Celsius or Blockfi.
!!comment!!: the sec is fucking the market even harder than inflation. good job protectors.
!!comment!!: Couple of days ago: I wish for another buying opportunity at lower prices

Now: Oh shit what is happening?
!!comment!!: Who cares, keep up with the monthly buys and reap the insane profits in a year or so! Easy money, this game is just too damn easy.
!!comment!!: It must‚Äôve been green, but it‚Äôs over now.
!!comment!!: Remember the before times?

Like an hour ago?
!!comment!!: Looool crypto is so dumb and I‚Äôm dumb for enjoying this shit, what even happened this time
!!comment!!: Pump hard, dump hard baby.
!!comment!!: I chose a great time to buy Arbitrum pump and dump coins (yesterday) :(
!!comment!!: Close the chart and ride it out.
!!comment!!: What if the US government is secretly run by vampires and that's why they want to ban staking? /s
!!comment!!: SEC announcement was a joke, no need for staking(lending) on CEX.

Does this mean people won‚Äôt be able to short crypto anymore?
!!comment!!: People panic over the dumbest shit. This market is weird.
!!comment!!: It appears the dip I bought before was in fact NOT the dip.
!!comment!!: Inflates away your money so you‚Äôre forced into risk assets.

Destroys the value of your risk assets with nonstop regulations against good exchanges and let bad exchanges go unchecked.

Lol so how are we supposed to make money?
!!comment!!: ‚ÄòYou will own nothing and be happy‚Äô - Governments
!!comment!!: Finally the accumulation gods have listened. Use this as an opportunity to buy at a discount. The world hasn't ended, just a minor pit on the road.
!!comment!!: Thanks to the peeps who talked me out of fomoing into GRT yesterday. CC advice isn't always terrible.
!!comment!!: SEC: We did it! We saved US customers from gaining yield on their assets!
!!comment!!: 2 years ago today, Tesla bought $1.5 billion of BTC. Were you guys around at that time, I think at the time of the announcement there was a 5k green candle. Safe to say the crypto world went nuts.
!!comment!!: Maybe no Super Bowl ads will somehow spark the market‚Ä¶

What are you going to do?
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: BREAKING: SEC doesn‚Äôt understand staking.
!!comment!!: Fuck it I just caught the knife
!!comment!!: Feels like a lot of calculated fud articles these days with horrible click bait to try and tank this crypto rally.
!!comment!!: Important to note: Currently this will only effect US Kraken customers
!!comment!!: Does anyone else think the staking news is not as bad as we feared? 

It‚Äôs not an outright ban on staking but rather exchange staking - with the difference being that the SEC is not saying you can‚Äôt stake your crypto, as you can still do so natively on blockchains or DEXs etc, just not with exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. 

The SEC is probably just trying to prevent another FTX, Celsius, Voyager, the list goes on and on, from happening. I just hope there isn‚Äôt any regulatory creep with it.
!!comment!!: Because I've seen it posted wrong already a hundred times today:

The SEC did not ban staking. Kraken and the SEC reached a settlement that resulted in Kraken permanently removing their staking program in the US. 

This does not mean staking was banned. Kraken is now banned from staking in the US. That's all we know. They man be coming for Coinbase next, or trying to set a precedent with smaller exchanges first, but that's all speculation still. Maybe Kraken had some less than savvy things going on with their program? Yet again, speculation. 

Stick to the facts. Too many people spreading FUD already.
!!comment!!: The SEC is the ultimate shit coin
!!comment!!: Market dipping on my day DCA schedule? Don't mind if I do.
!!comment!!: I finally set up my vault after looking from the sidelines for a while now. I feel accomplished
!!comment!!: It always amazes me how fast the mentality changes here in the sub. 

From bullish to crabby to bearish in a matter of hours.
!!comment!!: You guys are overreacting. I've been reading you for a while before checking prices and I thought the crash was much bigger than this. We're at 22.5k for god's sake. We were at 16k not even a month ago. Relax.

!!comment!!: Almost done importing all of my crypto into Koinly (for U.S. tax purposes). And I'd just like to say that binance.us is a shit show. KuCoin? No problem. Coinbase? No problem. Most wallets? No problem. But [binance.us](https://binance.us)? Absolute shit show. Nothing is even remotely close to correct. CSV file? Off by a mile. API? Off by 2 miles. I don't know what to do. [binance.US](https://binance.US) was my primary exchange all year, so tons of transactions. I'm going to set my hair on fire..
!!comment!!: Looks like uncertainty is back on the menu looking at the stock market. Not a big surprise consider how the FED basically told the bulls to fuck off with their unexpected rate hike plan.

Wasn‚Äôt surprising tbh a 6%+ rates makes way more sense to fight back a 6-8% inflation. Better to get it done safely before a double inflation cycle crashes the markets like 2008. 

Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to see the markets just shake around in a 20-30% price range through the year with whales milking retail on SEC news and others
!!comment!!: Friendly reminder that staking made up 11% of Coinbase revenue in Q3.
!!comment!!: Bitcoin losing strength here, below the 8EMA (yellow line) is a sign of weakness as it was bouncing off it throughout the uptrend. Still within the range at the moment but it ain't looking good bruv

!!comment!!: Fun fact: Bitcoin has hit the CVDD floor 4 times in its history and the last time was about 3 months ago. Every time it has hit the CVDD floor a new all time high was made before hitting the CVDD floor again.

More info:

CVDD (Cumulative Value Days Destroyed) has historically picked the bottom of the market. It works off the theory that when significantly old coins (say bought at $10) pass to new investors (say at $10,000), the market perceives a higher floor.
!!comment!!: Why does it say bronze and cc:21 under my username?

I don‚Äôt own a pc, and I don‚Äôt have enough invested to even invest in a cold wallet. So I‚Äôm looking at trust and metamask. But, I want it to store btc, ETH and SHIB. Do I need multiple wallets? 

Does each type of coin get stored in its own wallet with its own seed phrase? 

I‚Äôm reading that they‚Äôre compatible with Binance and coinbase. What if you have coins on crypto.com? What do you do then?

The whole process makes me nervous tbh bc I‚Äôm so flighty. Trying to do it in the most fail proof, eili5, crypto for dummies way.

I‚Äôm DYOR‚Äôing right now but these are the questions that I‚Äôm just struggling with.

!!comment!!: I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but using smart contracts to stake is not custodial. 

Smart contracts are by definition automated code. They have defined inputs and defined outputs; if this, then that.

Being ‚Äòlocked‚Äô in a smart contract doesn‚Äôt mean you do not have custody. All coins are still cryptographically owned by you and your wallet.

Custody refers to giving someone else the legal right or guardianship of your assets. This does not happen with a smart contract.

What are your Coin Couples?

Which coins or tokens do you feel naturally pair well together for whatever reason you have? 

It could be because they work great in a portfolio, they are opposites that attract, they‚Äôve got a common interest, or they‚Äôre from the same ‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù, like BUSD and BNB.

!!comment!!: Helium miner rant - lost 3 rigs over the past week

I‚Äôve been mining helium awhile now and decided to invest a lot into building some long range solar-powered rigs to extend my network. I set up some units in Utah in the fall and got a great rural network up and running. Unfortunately, putting the rigs up on ‚Äústate land‚Äù was not a great idea, and they‚Äôve been taken down one by one by some locals who don‚Äôt understand the importance of the coming global Internet of Things.


So after all those rigs lost I‚Äôm at least 10 years away from profit due to this setback. Anyway. I decided to bring my networks a little higher, somewhere authorities who don‚Äôt understand crypto won‚Äôt be able to just take down. I figured that you‚Äôve got to spend money to make money. So I bought and launched a few dirigibles and drones to take my helium mining rigs to the skies, where they won‚Äôt bother anyone - or so I thought. In the last week alone, 3 of my rigs have been shot down by F-22‚Äôs all over the country and in Canada. My network is a wreck. I‚Äôm beginning to think that I may never financially recover from this, and now I‚Äôm seriously worried my wife is gonna find out.

(*yes this is a joke*)
!!comment!!: Quick, while the Americans are busy with the Super Bowl, lets gossip about them

!!comment!!: Guys do you think the dca day matters?

!!comment!!: Alright, take your sports gambling winnings and put them into crypto
!!comment!!: I‚Äôve collected my CDC diamond today, as I do every day from the toilet once I‚Äôm awake
!!comment!!: When has SEC ever protected retail investors in crypto or even stocks? Now they are suing paxos for issuing Busd and other stable coins. Where were they when SBF and do kwon was scamming the whole space.
!!comment!!: Feels very doom and gloom today, even more so than when bitcoin was 15k.
!!comment!!: People leaving BUSD like a forest fire.
!!comment!!: Was there any bad crypto news today?
!!comment!!: I thought the SEC was in the business of regulation, instead they seem content to line their pockets with fines while swinging their ban hammer.
!!comment!!: Super excited for the next ETH Shanghai update, anyone else excited?
!!comment!!: Sending smoke signals out to the cryptoverse
!!comment!!: Maybe I‚Äôm an anomaly, but I feel like crypto couldn‚Äôt be the Wild West forever and sec regulation was only a matter of time. Personally the fact that there‚Äôs no real official public tether reserves keeps me from ever owning some. Who‚Äôs to say they‚Äôre not degenning all your money behind the scenes.

If they have a framework they can operate within and it boots trust and transparency without going too far that‚Äôs fine.

!!comment!!: About to go mine some fiat, have a good day everyone
!!comment!!: Just passed my second financial advisor assessment. I get to keep my job! (For now at least).
!!comment!!: According to CZ tweet:  "BUSD, even though called Binance USD, is NOT issued or redeemed by Binance." I don't know if its safe to be holding busd now.
!!comment!!: Wow, CZ Binance just announced that BUSD is basically dead and they will be seeing people migrate to a new stablecoin because of it.

Heres the tweet storyline: https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1625067484368740353?cxt=HHwWgoCx3YuRs40tAAAA


So Im guessing its going to end up being USDC.
!!comment!!: Maybe things would be different if the crypto community/ industry had stood with XRP when the SEC sued Ripple.
!!comment!!: A bull, a bear and a crab meet in a bar. Nothing happens. End.
!!comment!!: The NEW YORK department of financial services is asking PAXOS to stop issuing Binance‚Äôs BUSD.            But in the other hand. Paxos said that all existing BUSD tokens will remain fully supported and redeemable through the Paxos Trust until at least February 2024!!
!!comment!!: Looks like a good day to buy some more eth üòä
!!comment!!: Wow all the red. Makes me sad.
!!comment!!: Stock markets rips and crypto dumps :/ nice
!!comment!!: Strap into your seat boys, it‚Äôs going to be a wild ride.
!!comment!!: what i don't get is why BUSD and not USDT?  You would think the SEC would see Tether as a much bigger problem.
!!comment!!: solution:  everyone that has busd, just move that into btc.  

would be fun to see 15b of market cap suddenly added.
!!comment!!: wahaha im out for this dump, enjoy

!!comment!!: Had $25 left in my trading account that I didn‚Äôt put into anything on my DCA day. Couldn‚Äôt figure out what to do with it.

Topped up another $25 and split it between BTC and ETH. Can‚Äôt go wrong with those two.
!!comment!!: Link at $24 used to be a deal üò© what is this new world üò≥

!!comment!!: How is BUSD a Security?  
  
A Security is: (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits (4) earned through the efforts of others.
!!comment!!: If you haven‚Äôt installed 2FA yet. I suggest you do.
!!comment!!: If paxos cant mint BUSD, im not sure what will keep BUSD blowing above $1 if traders decide they want to depeg it upwards
!!comment!!: Does anyone know if tomorrows CPI report can be watched live anywhere? Seems i cant find any relevant info source.
!!comment!!: I have 0.00003262 BTC left on localbitcoins, this is lower than their insane withdrawal fee.

They are free to send to another localbitcoins wallet though. If anyone has enough BTC on localbitcoins to withdraw and hasn't done so, I'll glady send you this dust for free. I'd rather give it away then let it sit on their site.
!!comment!!: Seriously do I need to sell my BUSD or is this just a minor reaction to the future of BUSD closing???
!!comment!!: Don't worry. It is only money. There are more important things in life.
!!comment!!: Is there any good resources that explain moons and how they work or is the limited info Reddit gives us it?

!!comment!!: ROSE f**** flying as expected
!!comment!!: Don't know who is pumping Rose, but keep going. It's 1 of my smallest bag but it broke even.

Damn it feels good to see things braking even again.
!!comment!!: Gonna be a great day when Eth gets past 2k
!!comment!!: Inflation under control. soft landing! Fed pivot! economy looks great. Everything is fine!
!!comment!!: Investing in cryptocurrency means you are postponing from consuming in the present in favor of consuming more in the future.
!!comment!!: There is a certain fractal element about this market.  That is, once every 4 years, you have a big alt run (a.k.a. alt season) but more frequently, you have little alt runs (just like the current one).  Most of these alt runs (little or huge) end badly with a major dumping.  The signature of these runs ending is that Bitcoin starts to stall (like right now), but retailers are so busy with alt  FOMO that they stop paying attention to Bitcoin as they look for the next coin to moon.

I think this is what is happening right now.  Beware as this type of Bitcoin struggling with alts running never ever ends good.
!!comment!!: Do Moons even have chance to be listed on big cex's considering Reddit is currently dont wanna deal with the legal issues that may come up with Moons in the future?
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Just bought more moons using Moonpay to buy ETH onto Arbitrum One, then sushiswapping onto Nova AND THEN swapping for Moons

!!comment!!: What happens to ROSE, just up 28% to $0.074
!!comment!!: NEAR just tweeted about AI and the price jumped. Guess it's the season.
!!comment!!: Who is this Craig wright guy and why does he wanna trademark Bitcoin?
!!comment!!: I posted here 12 months ago about the supply squeeze for moons hitting EXACTLY in February of 2023 where 69% of the overall supply would have already been distributed.  Given the burn rate, and BEFORE these ad projects became known.  This is the month that from here on out, moons will be scarce.  However that was before all of the karma max implementation rules.  Still this is the month and from here on, best of luck grabbing them on the cheap.
!!comment!!: My little bag of FET has grown. Anyone else in on any AI coins?
!!comment!!: I‚Äôm still $700 away from breakeven. Cmon crypto keep going please üôè
!!comment!!: BREAKING NEWS: Reddit has announced Moons will be the official AI coin of Reddit. When asked about what that specifically means, an admin claimed "idk machine learning go brrr". The price of moons is currently skyrocketing like many other AI coins as many claim this will be a paradigm shift in AI computing.
!!comment!!: This is my break even point. Or at least as close as I can estimate until I sit down and do the maths for a years worth of DCA. Not too shabby for the long term imo
!!comment!!: Anyone else glad they stuck it out through all of the bad news and drama and believed in the principles of decentralization and transparency?
!!comment!!: Well that was an expensive vet visit to take away my DCA. Atleast my pup is fine and nothing life threatening

Edit: id sell and give away my whole portfolio for my dog. She‚Äôs worth it
!!comment!!: Let's make something clear

There is no material integration between AI and Crypto. 

You cannot put AI 'into a blockchain'.

!!comment!!: is DOT the best purchase that can be done today?
!!comment!!: I am commenting in the daily for the first time in a long time. Bullish! üöÄ
!!comment!!: Something bad about DOT ? I mean there is a lot going on in programming and it's a 5x to the old ATH. Maybe in the next bullrun it goes even higher. Seems a solid investment or do I miss something ?
!!comment!!: Are you more an active crypto investor or a passive one? Passive: you buy some coins and then not really follow what is happening with what you bought. Active: you follow all or most of your coins and stay up to date with what is going on with them on at least a monthly basis or more often and possibly move your crypto around some and not just have it sit on an exchange.
!!comment!!: Out of curiosity how‚Äôs everyone doing this bear market, anyone break even, in profits, still in the red?
!!comment!!: Just got my Super Bowl avatar baby! Go birds ü¶Ö

!!comment!!: If you had to pick three alts that aren't Ethereum to DCA, what would they be, and what is your split %-wise?
!!comment!!: For the average person whom is likely to live long enough to still be around in 20 years, getting one whole Bitcoin into your bag before the next bullrun, and keeping it that long, may very well trump any other investment you'll ever have the opportunity to make.
!!comment!!: Has the new bull run started???? Omg!  I am greeen I am greeeeeen in 4 out of 27 of my shit coins
!!comment!!: Bitcoin ready to pop. 30k eom?
!!comment!!: Our beloved moons are going to moon
!!comment!!: Imagine that, moons cost more than any popular dog themed shit coins
!!comment!!: Say moons go on a crazy run in the future and you end up being able to swap your bag 1:1 with a full BTC, would you do it? On one hand having the opportunity to jump ship into a full BTC would offer a bit more safety, but if moons go to $10 or something crazy it would be better to hodl‚Ä¶ Just a thought I‚Äôve been tinkering with in my head lately.
!!comment!!: Oh my god ROSE. Go you beautiful thing üåπüåπüåπ

I gotta thank [Fetch.ai](https://Fetch.ai) for going bananas over the last couple months; wish I had bought a bigger bag. Shout out to Litecoin and Bitcoin for holding the fort. Gotta give Jasmy a little nudge like "you awake, bro? I've seen your volume lately. It's time to go." 

  
Nonetheless, I hope to have at least a month or so of some dampened financial worries. And by the end of the year, perhaps a new pot of savings to disperse into a Roth and other smart financial moves.

Stay saucy, r/Cryptocurrency
!!comment!!: JPOW: We expect inflation to go down significantly in 2023
!!comment!!: I have been gone for 1 day what the fuck is an AI coin lmao
!!comment!!: Damn, what a shit day (personally speaking). 

Finally managed to get in touch with my family in Turkey. My aunt was badly hurt (broken leg and pelvis) but is in stable condition at the hospital, and everyone else is fine or just has minor cuts and bruises. But their entire home and possessions have been destroyed, as their apartment block/building collapsed during the aftermath. 

Hope everyone else has had a better day though; good to see the daily so active again. Just needed to vent for a bit.
!!comment!!: THIS CYCLE SO FAR: 

1. AI coins pumped to start things off.   Then they cooled down for a few weeks. 

.
2.  Other coins pumped. Metaverse, and layer ones like FTM, INJ, etc.  They cooled off. 

.
3. Meme coins pumped.  They cooled off. 

Now, AI coins are pumping again after their break. They should be about ready for another break about now. 

So........  Next should be layer ones again, since they have cooled off and are ready to rocket.  üöÄ

!!comment!!: Hummingbirds can fly in all directions - forward, backward, up, down, and sideways. They can even hover in one spot.

Reminds me of the price action of a particular coin
!!comment!!: The 3 AI coins (OCEAN,GRT and FET) I threw money in 24 hours ago are going really really well. Plus the AGIX I bought some days ago seems unstoppable. 
Following random people advice in this sub pays off sometime
!!comment!!: Crypto run on narrative and hype. It's AI coins season and I think I will submit to the narrative and buy Fet or something
!!comment!!: Whatever you guys have been wrong before, I just FOMOD hard into GRT

!!comment!!: BTC formed GOLDEN CROSS. Not sure what that means, I think Pope bought some bitcoin
!!comment!!: I don‚Äôt want to ruin anyone‚Äôs party, but GRT is forming a bear flag in the 1m chart atm.
!!comment!!: Y‚Äôall were calling bull trap but that was actually a bear trap
!!comment!!: If we get improved CPI numbers next week that‚Äôs a strikeout for the bears
!!comment!!: I just doubled my money on GRT. Well thank you Coinbase Earn for that free GRT.
!!comment!!: My dad is a crypto skeptic and one of my goals is to be able to buy him a new car (nothing too fancy) to replace his old one using my crypto profits.
!!comment!!: Can someone explain how exactly GRT counts as an AI coin? 
I got lucky in that I bought a bunch of it last summer, but that was because I'd read about how important the indexing would be. I knew nothing about its association with AI.
!!comment!!: Idk about you guys, but I'm buying up any quality alts that are still down 90%+ from their ATH. That's a minimum 10x just to get back to a price they already were. 

Just in case you weren't aware, here are a few examples that Reddit has liked in the past: GRT, ALGO, ONE, THETA, HOT, SAND, CRO, RUNE, VET, the list goes on. All over 90% down.

Edit: Totally did not realize it was my cake day. Thanks guys!
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: My portfolio is up $8 today. Is there any crypto sub for whales? I don‚Äôt wanna breathe the same air with you peasants.
!!comment!!: Great another useless avatar added to my collection! Bullish
!!comment!!: BTC is up 45% since the Nov-22 low $15742
!!comment!!: I know this sub hates AI coins, but these dang things are pumping ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
!!comment!!: You guys keep talking about fet and singularity and what not, show some love to the top of the list of AI coins my boy The Graph. 

Please please I am still 70% down.
!!comment!!: I work in IT.  Honestly, every man and his dog is talking about ChatGPT and AI at the moment.    The OpenAI API is pretty good and a licence to print money.  You pay for the text you pass in and pay for the text you pass out.

Obviously crypto wants a part of that.  Certainly it will crash and burn, but will it crash sooner or later, that is the real question.
!!comment!!: AI Just won't go down. Been tracking RNDR, FET and AGIX in the top 100 and every time there is a pull-back, there is a bounce up to a new level no matter what BTC does.

Not sure how long it will last, but I suppose with inflation stats out tonight, it might make a move in a big way up or down.
!!comment!!: FOMO into GRT, FET and RNDR?

Yes or no?
!!comment!!: The GRT supply change really screwed a lot of early adopters, crazy to see how far it is from ATH even with current hype
!!comment!!: Brb I‚Äôm about to fomo chase a pump
!!comment!!: I think I‚Äôm about to hit my first 100% profit on a coin. I started in 2021 but only focused on my main 3 coins. This year i switched up and took a bet 3 weeks ago and it‚Äôs paying off. Feels good!
!!comment!!: I must admit, even though my redditt nft's are limited, I enjoy changing my avatar more than a grown man should.
!!comment!!: My bank refused me making a deposit to Kraken yesterday, despite allowing this previously (including last month). Co-operative Bank (UK). Dinosaurs.
!!comment!!: I'm looking at buying some Moons on MEXC, I'm normally just a buy bitcoin from Coinbase and send to my ledger guy but I fancy having a stack of Moons to strut around this sub with, plus they've got future potential I expect. 

Is there a decent post about this? 

I'm thinking I've got to send USDT to MEXC wallet, buy moons with a USDT,  then send to my Reddit Vault address? Is that about it?
!!comment!!: i lost my appetite after things happened around me.(in Turkey) we're living on the edge of death my friends. Just enjoy the moment.
!!comment!!: "Don't FOMO into GRT", they told me last month... "don't chase a pump"... "it won't hold $0.08"...
!!comment!!: Love you ETH, you are my only hope
!!comment!!: JPOW pump and dump.. gross.
!!comment!!: Accumulated some coins during that little pump, pump got cancelled & went back to where it started. My apologies ladies & gentleman.
!!comment!!: Balls deep in Shitcoins. Hold my beer.
!!comment!!: Trade the short term outlook 

Invest the long term outlook 

Don‚Äôt mix up both or you‚Äôll get rekt
!!comment!!: This organic price movement is great!
!!comment!!: Did anyone see the Binance.US bitcoin chart last night? That candle to 17k is scary. I‚Äôm assuming a shit ton of liquidations happened, orders filled, etc. anyone affected?
!!comment!!: A steady market can be boring in the short term but you will love those long term gains
!!comment!!: The beauty of DCA is that I genuinely don't give a shit what the market does. I'll buy every 2 weeks, stake what can be staked, and leave the rest to the crypto gods.
!!comment!!: Seems like we‚Äòre just waiting for ETH to get its own golden cross event around the 12th before we can blast off.
!!comment!!: Dollar going down again

Time for sneks
!!comment!!: How is everyone doing today? Congrats to GRT hodlers
!!comment!!: Just DCA some BTC, feeling good. What about you guys?
!!comment!!: Ok stock market closed now lets continue pumping
!!comment!!: Time for all coins from 2017 to rebrand into AI coins. Very sure this is happening.
!!comment!!: Looks like metaverse coins are about to be the flavor of the week soon
!!comment!!: I'm demanding the gulf countries go 100% into crypto after the oil era, Thanks.
!!comment!!: Every coin will pump except for the ones I have and things won‚Äôt stop pumping until I fomo. But I‚Äôll never fomo, so you‚Äôre welcome guys.
!!comment!!: Good morning from Aus, have a good one!
!!comment!!: It's 2 years this week since I first jumped into crypto. Was just checking through my portfolio and notes to see some stats.

At either extreme the furthest I've been is -52% and +94%. 

Biggest losses - thought I could beat the bots on new token launches in 2021. DODO and ALICE. Lost about $130 before moving the rest to BTC 

Biggest single profit - LUNA around the time of the crash and bounce. 72x. Put in $10.80, pulled out $780.

I sold some FTM last month so I'm still an idiot at times. 

Generally, if there's one thing I'd wish I'd done better it would be to take MORE profits.
!!comment!!: I took double my profits from GRT of the initial investment I put in during december and put it in BTC. I'm letting the rest of my investment ride out which makes it easy to have no regrets. This is my strategy for lower cap alt coins from now on, you can't guarantee they will make it which makes them high risk compared to BTC/ETH (in an already high risk market).  


During 2020/2021 I made the mistake of holding onto coins which pumped hard for too long (ADA/LRC/LINK) without taking enough profits so I made up a strategy to give me zero stress and it guarantees you will double your initial BTC stack investment (or you can take out the investment amount in USD/EUROS if you want). If you take out your investment plus profits of the same amount as your investment in an alt coin it gives you insurance you at least made some profits, and if the pump on the coin was big enough (almost 400% in GRT case) you will have enough of the alt coin left which makes it easier to cope when you see the coin down 90%+ when you wake up one day.
!!comment!!: Well. It finally happened. I dropped my phone in the toilet.

After I peed. üôÉüôÉüôÉ
!!comment!!: How do I get moons? I have activated my vault

!!comment!!: I get irrationally excited when new avatars roll out
!!comment!!: 2 more hours night shift left.

Tonight I have decided nightshifts are worse than red dildo days. 

Tick,tock,tick,tock..

!!comment!!: When I die, I want Link to lower me into my grave so it can let me down one last time
!!comment!!: Only 10 people here. Half of them are bots. So only 5 real people.

Here, I'll buy you all  breakfast.
!!comment!!: Got an email talking about ‚Äúyour withdrawal of 0.74 BTC is complete, click this link to view full transaction‚Äù LOL I wish I had that much money
!!comment!!: Crypto is helping me retire early because the stress reduces my life expectancy
!!comment!!: If the next bull run doesn‚Äôt give us 100k then I‚Äôm gonna move to a remote shack and rock in a corner for eternity
!!comment!!: Arsenal dropped more points than my portfolio has today
!!comment!!: 17 People here tonight! 

Let's say half of them are bots, that leaves 9 real people.

9 real people, I'll buy a drink for! What's your poison!
!!comment!!: Meh old daily just ended when i made this comment but let me repeat its important : 

"I just got a reminder so to say from another comment.

Did you guys notice how ALL the comments are gone asking about how much you hold in a bearmarket? I just never comes up

You know why ? Because that were all scammers trying to get data from people here so they can impersonate you with CS

So try not to tell everyone your exchange/gender/age/living location and things like your real life name

If you have any of that info in your reddit comments delete that crap and dont fall for it once the masses come back

Ohh also check if you got random followers to your account. Thats all bots scanning your comments for such data. Block em"

Just saw such a comment asking for peoples age. Its not save that this person is a scammer.. what is save is that scammers will see it and note it down

Edit : Also you should now.. if you delete something yourself it cant be restored even with undelete reddits. So if a mod removed it go into your comment history and delete it there as well
!!comment!!: After watching a video by Gary Gensler on crypto staking today I‚Äôm now bullish on crypto regulation. I misspoke yesterday on this general chat, he‚Äôs not trying to screw Americans in crypto he just wants exchanges to be transparent about how they use American‚Äôs crypto when it is staked. Super bullish and bought more today
!!comment!!: According to my hamster we will pump to 25k next week. Get ready frens.
!!comment!!: thank you SEC for allowing me to explore other staking options
!!comment!!: Up way too early and the first thing I do is check the charts and see what's happening in here, do I have a problem
!!comment!!: Eat, sleep, shitpost, repeat
!!comment!!: Alright, I'm warning you, the first one of you to call this a pump is getting slapped
!!comment!!: No ones said it in a while so, fuck Gary and the SEC
!!comment!!: Decided to mix things up today, decided to dabble into DEX's for the first time, had some fun using fusion on 1inch....

After all my onramping, fee payments... just noticed you can directly buy ETH into metamask via a coinbase integration. FML
!!comment!!: Still operating at a half Bitcoin and half fiat portfolio. Trying to time these pumps is a huge risk and it can backfire in an instant.

EDIT: just a little bit of advice to anybody that might value it... This isn't the sort of market condition that I'd be looking to day-trade in. Too unpredictable. Crabbing doesn't equate to low-risk. This is actually the sort of scenario where DCA is probably a good shout if you have the surplus income to facilitate it. I rarely promote DCA but it's very much an accumulation scenario.
!!comment!!: Imagine going out on a weekend instead of sitting alone in the dark on your couch shit posting about crypto. Lol.
!!comment!!: Hey hey new daily same shitposting :))
!!comment!!: DCA day, what a good way to start the weekend.
!!comment!!: So‚Ä¶ when does jpm throw coinbase out as a client? 

Context - https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-banking-services-crypto-exchanges-coinbase-gemini/577758/

Given the past week, I can imagine reg pressure will impact the amount of  reputational risk that jpm is willling to take in

!!comment!!: Could someone ELI5 to me how this new karma and moons system works? Did something change? Last month, I was supposed to get more moons, but I only got little, so I wonder how that can be?
!!comment!!: I'd recommend watching the Netflix documentary about Bernie Madoff if you haven't watched it.

One thing struck me about it was how chronically underfunded the SEC claimed to be. But even so it seems they've been spending a huge amount of resources anf focus on CryptoCurrency recently.
!!comment!!: Good morning to the 12 people along me here
!!comment!!: The amount of crypto-related bullshit available on YouTube is stunning
!!comment!!: My holdings at the moment are half Bitcoin and half fiat. Feel like that's a sensible, low-risk approach, particularly because I don't know whether we're done dipping yet. Wouldn't be surprised if we see a couple more red candles on the 4H charts which will weed out longs and allow whales to accumulate.
!!comment!!: Doing my DCA today fuck it
!!comment!!: Will we break 2k comments today? I think not
!!comment!!: Eth holding this 1500 level pretty well, as long as Btc doesn‚Äôt decide to take a dip below 21.2k, which we haven‚Äôt touched yet but that‚Äôs where the support is, we should hopefully resume the bullish momentum this coming week. That could all get reversed if cpi comes in hot though, if we beat expectations though on the cpi, we are definitely looking at some new bullish movements for at least a couple of weeks

!!comment!!: My legit condolences to ALBT holders.  I read the postmortem and that's the kind of shit that scares me the most.  AllianceBlock didn't get hacked or anything.  110 million of their 1 billion supply was drained (and sold) on the Bonq protocol (whatever the fuck that is) causing a massive collapse of the token value.  My first question is why is 10% of the total supply on some obscure protocol?  But even worse is that AllianceBlock is now minting a new token (out of panic imho).  

What a disaster.  Hard to see them rebounding from this, but it is possible I suppose.  I guess the lesson is if you're serious about your project don't lend 10% of your supply to some no-name defi protcol.  Idk, maybe AllianceBlock is sketchier than I give them credit for.
!!comment!!: What's your guys thoughts on a decentralized website that it's focus is Steam (the gaming platform) trading. It uses smart contracts to assist in safe trading.

Both parties agree to the trade which then triggers the smart contracts and only once both accept.

Basically you'd drag your items or currency into the trade slot and then it will allow you to select a box where it ticks off - which will then lock your trading box so nothing can move in and/or out, with a 10-second timer going down to give you chance to look over and make sure both sides of the trade is what both parties were looking for, after that 10 seconds the accept or trade button goes green and both parties are then able to accept, trigger the smart contract and complete the trade. 

There can also be a chat box added to keep communication there for both parties but with privacy still in place having no access of knowing who you are talking to.

!!comment!!: I feel my LRC bags getting lighter :))))

Shorts are getting Rekt (Liquidations) - $500k worth of LRC shorts in the past 24 hours

https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData

What I find most interesting is that some of these are LRC-USDT-SWAP and LRCUSDT from Binance. Tether is being used to suppress LRC (as well as other cryptos).

- u/surf243
!!comment!!: The shorts are getting liquidated and a speed today, everyone will be going long then BOOM price drops and its disastrous for the longs too. Classic

Today I bought 0.2 LTC. This is my 271st day of purchasing; 181 days remain until halving. Feels good to be entirely positive :)
!!comment!!: The bears are getting agitated. They're predicting laugable reversals and are becoming openly hostile. To me, this posturing smacks of desperation and I think it's a pretty bullish sign that they are just about exhausted. Enjoy hibernation bears, see you sometime after the halving. ‚úåüèº

!!comment!!: For anyone interested FOMC meeting is in 5.50 hours as I type this out so you can add this to your local time
!!comment!!: Goodbye January, may February bring us more joy
!!comment!!: There's way too much confidence in a 25 BPS hike.

Rates currently sit at 4.25%-4.50% after all these hikes that ended the 0% era: 25, 50, 75, 75, 75, 75, 50....

The pattern is obvious... too obvious. Everything points towards 25 BPS, which even makes sense if they're going to have 8 meetings this year to increase a further 2% before they settle on 6.25%-6.50% for a quarter or two before pivoting.

Is there any reason the Fed would do 50 just to fuck with everyone? Would they have any justification?
!!comment!!: So crab until FED meeting? Anyone know how many hours of waiting left?
!!comment!!: Cramer: buy

Burry: sell 

Fed: economy needs to slow down for 2% inflation

!!comment!!: So this is kind of neat...

Apparently, Coinbase has been running a Knicks contest which I was automatically entered into when I bought USDC.

Last Thursday, Coinbase reached out to me saying I was one of the winners selected for 4 free tickets to next week's game against the Nets at MSG. 

Thought it was a scam at first, but turned out to be legit. Filled out the paperwork and just got the tickets today!

!!comment!!: Last year I was sitting in a cabin in the woods reading the daily and I read a comment from this crazy dude who said he was buying LTC daily and keeping track of it in a spreadsheet.

He even shared his spreadsheet, and I thought to myself "Well, here I am in a cabin in the woods, living my best life and doing what I said I wanted to do, and this guy's going to be living his best life by accumulating all this LTC before the halving, and he's so confident he's showing us how much skin he has in the game!"

So I started accumulating right there and then.

LTC is now my biggest bag with an average cost of $57.87.

LTC dude, wherever you are, may your ramen have an egg in it today üôè

!!comment!!: So I know Matic has pumped hard the last 30 days and has done extremely well over the last 9 months.  Not complaining, but would expect a much larger pump assuming the the zkEVM launch goes according to plan.  To my knowledge (which is to be debated) their team has a pretty good reputation for success.  They say it will go live in 1st quarter.  Just curious if this is rocket waiting to go higher or is the launch ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù and this is orbit?

This blows my tiny mind. Im very new in the industry and am already thinking writing may not be the best industry to get into if a bot can do my job but better and faster. At the moment it still needs us to operate it but I can‚Äôt help but feel like this is the beginning of something greater.

!!comment!!: I personally wouldn't buy the dip this early.  The whales tend to slowly bleed out the price actions over a long timescale so the fish who have FOMO start buying at any 3-5% dips.
!!comment!!: Good morning all l, hope you have a good week at the fiat mines
!!comment!!: I bought at 24k with liquidation at 16k, I dun goofed innit?

!!comment!!: I'm planning on staking some of my funds on kraken long term, is it safu?
!!comment!!: Sorry for the duplicate, but the question was burried earlier.. Do I understand correctly that moons from all burns help shaping up higher ratio of current round? AMAs/Banners/Bridge to Nova/MoonPlace ones?
!!comment!!: This morning as the stock market opened I played around with 50x leverage trading on GMX. I was not liquidated but did sell at a 10-15% loss. I was only playing around with $20. I cannot imagine gambling $100, $1000, or more. It's stressful enough watching the charts move against your position even when it's that small.

Glad to experience it, but my fantasy of day trading was ended abruptly.
!!comment!!: Got two weeks of full home office. Bullish.
!!comment!!: >Fox sells out Super Bowl ads: crypto out, alcohol in. "There‚Äôs zero representation in that category on the day at all" says Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports.

!!comment!!: What do u guys think will happen Tmr , I‚Äôm thinking a red day
!!comment!!: Original plan for 2023: Big caps only, switch to shitcoins closer to 2024. BTC > ETH > DOT.

Reality: DOT, TAO, GLMR, METIS, EFI, AVAX, ETH, BTC, ASTR.

..That escalated quickly. Can recommend Bittensor (TAO). AI chain on Polkadot which held up during this latest dip. A bit quirky to get but should get some cex listings later this month.

We don't know shit about fuck.
!!comment!!: I've been here for 2 years, so proud of how moons have kept their value and how this community is still great!
!!comment!!: I just checked unstoppable domains. Am I misunderstanding the website? It seems that they want between 1000 and 100000 USD for most domains. On ENS I pay 5 USD per year for my .eth addresses which seems like a much better deal. 

I just wanted some domains without ETH in the name to use for other cryptocurrencies
!!comment!!: If you use kraken, they enabled two kinds aus staking for a few coins recently, e.g. DOT. you can now either stake and unstake immediately or have an unstaking period of about 20 days depending on the coin but get much higher apy.

They also added 2.5% APY for Euro fiat which is nice.
!!comment!!: Dip on AGIX. Will happily buy again if it goes lower.

!!comment!!: The dump finally came. I guess it‚Äôs back to the usual Sunday‚Äôs we have always know.
!!comment!!: [This wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/banner_records/) will track burns from banner rentals. Probably will migrate this page somewhere else at some point but this will work for now
!!comment!!: First time I saw a snake in Australia. May Snake God blesses crypto.
!!comment!!: *\*DefinitelyNotAScammer wants to send you a message\**
!!comment!!: My personal opinion. LTC is a safe bet after BTC
!!comment!!: So that 1 inch banner ad, its been up for more than 3 days. Did they extend their ad time, because if they did that's freakin great at 9k/day Moons burnt.
!!comment!!: Lately the market pumps while I sleep. So I'm gonna take one for the team. Night y'all!
!!comment!!: First sign of incoming red ( i know its 1% for btc and eth üòÇ) is that shib was pumping
!!comment!!: Yes, yes bitcoin, we get it. You can be red when you want to be. That 1% dip was very scary. Surprised pikachu faces all round. Now let's get back to the gainz.
!!comment!!: Sold AGIX an hour ago and it continues to rise. But, profit is a profit.
!!comment!!: why did everything suddenly turn slightly red?
!!comment!!: Sub keeps talking about AI tokens. But what am I looking for to DYOR on these coins? Is it still early for them or are they like DOGE ATH prices when people were wishing they‚Äôd gotten in 6 months earlier?

!!comment!!: I haven‚Äôt seen a battle like this since Helm‚Äôs Deep.
!!comment!!: Will start buying more of the dip when bears and buttcoiners start saying "I told you so"
!!comment!!: Finally we are getting the Sunday dip lol
!!comment!!: Of course the single one Altcoin I sell and take profita goes on a fucking rampage and outperforms BTC by 3x while the rest keeps shitting the bed.
!!comment!!: Our only hope now is the stock futures when they open in a few hoursü§û
!!comment!!: Sunday being the best day for DCA is not a meme
!!comment!!: Founder of Chainlink Sergey Nazarov bought the domain smartcontract(dot)com 6 days before the bitcoin whitepaper was released. He has the same initials as Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi used an IP address used by a man named Sergey. The second language enabled in the bitcoin talk forum was Russian. Sergey had clearly displayed his affinity for Japanese culture throughout the years. Sergey has backpedaled multiple times the date on which he began to work in crypto.

Do you think he may be satoshi or had a link to him? One of my favorite crypto conspiracies.
!!comment!!: Don‚Äôt worry guys, we are 1 day closer to the next bull run
!!comment!!: good night good folks, hope you have a great Saturday night
!!comment!!: What‚Äôs up with the SHIB explosion?
!!comment!!: Which 'crypto super power' would you like to have and why?

Almost never see it mentioned anymore despite afaik being the first zk rollup.  


Not shilling (only have like $50) just surprised to see it so bereft of hype
!!comment!!: If it breaks down here a bit more, the ascending channel will break downward and most likely we see 20-21k.
!!comment!!: Deploying capital, steady lads.
!!comment!!: So AI tokens are the next big thing for the bull?
!!comment!!: OT today, compensated with lieu time so that I can sit on a beach later this month and shit post in the daily.
!!comment!!: Not buying significantly until sub 20k. That being said my auto-invest still doing DCA everyday, which tremendously helps curbing my FOMO.
!!comment!!: What is this, a dump for ants?
!!comment!!: The bears are going to try to break $23k for the thousandth time. Lol
!!comment!!: Bears are gonna take 23k, aren‚Äôt they?
!!comment!!: I bet the portfolio of hate is making a killing right now.
!!comment!!: When my wife and I first got together I carved our initials on a tree in her parent's backyard. For our 10th anniversary present I put our initials on the blockchain with my moonplace tiles. She's divorcing me.
!!comment!!: What should I invest in? Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, or my daughter's tuition?
!!comment!!: I miss shitcoin gambling meme coins, but it feels better just sticking to BTC
!!comment!!: Looks like the ugly AF H&S in the 4h finally this time wants to do the play (not like the last one which finished in a catastrophe for every shorter).

Add to it that BTC usually works as a canary in the mine for the Nasdaq on Sundays and we can finally have our red week to cold off a bit. Nothing to worry unless 22.5 first and 20k after are lost.

!!comment!!: I wonder why GRT is pumping alone
!!comment!!: The Graph had a good day today! Indexing and organizing the blockchain. Great tech, lots of utility. It's a long road to reclaim its ATH.
!!comment!!: In general, investment these days are all about (1) identifying what is a key trend and (2) jumping in early.  It was the same for DEFI, NFT, and now AI.  Really smart investors see the hype on Chat GPT and buys a lot of AI coins the right next day.  And then they sell at the top and wait until the next fad presents itself.  These are the people who make shit load of money in investing these days.
!!comment!!: My feeling is that someday I will be very grateful for having been able to buy a shit load of DOT at a cheap price ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
!!comment!!: If you didn't sell on green days then now ain't the time to sell imo.
!!comment!!: Sorry everybody, I was up late watching the charts last night and I fell asleep without putting the hummus away so now we've got a dip for germs.
!!comment!!: Prices are going down now

Time to get in and find that last bottom and pack all your bags
!!comment!!: Are "I bought, so it's dipping" jokes always this common or Is it something new?
!!comment!!: Crypto gods. Can we get an alt coin pump this week please?

!!comment!!: YouTube crypto influencers are dastards 

Never knew the word *dastard* existed until today & wanted to apply it üëÜüèΩ
!!comment!!: Commercials told me not to do my taxes
!!comment!!: We have all probably heard the phrase ‚Äúdumb and happy‚Äù.  I feel like after the last year, I‚Äôm  ‚Äúnumb and happy‚Äù. I‚Äôm happy at the way 2023 has started, but feeling numb to all price action, both positive and negative.  I feel like until I have enough to walk away it doesn‚Äôt really matter. The last year has truly made me numb to price swings and continue to invest with little emotion, which has actually started to pay off.
!!comment!!: Already the 5th of February. Damn time goes by quick. I guess it ain't so bad when everyday that goes by is one closer to adoption.. and the next bull.

Cheers to all you hodlers and hope you're all having a great weekend!
!!comment!!: Baby Doge is out for a rip.. up 40%
!!comment!!: if BTC hits 25k today, I'm gonna fap
!!comment!!: Anyone else have profit to rebuy with but still hesitant to buy for unknown reasons?
!!comment!!: Looks like in tw the trend is to discover if we re in the rally after the 'anger' (ftx bottom) or already in disbelief.

Personally, it would be a shame if after all this green BTC decided to have a healthy red week... Crushing some hopes

Edit...lesson learned, all of those rewards of a few cents here and there bumped me up into a higher plan based on transactions.  I could have saved 90 bucks by not getting like 30 dollars in rewards :(

!!comment!!: Cramer is like a really good basketball player before integration. Really good when the talent and competition was shit. Similar to his actual career, he was good before the advent of computers and retail getting access to trading and info‚Ä¶now he should be on the bench because he‚Äôs getting embarrassed by people crushing beers on their couch and buying ETH and BTC every time he says to get out
!!comment!!: I stayed up way too late watching charts

!!comment!!: It only took this pump to have profits in my portfolio. I surely cannot wait for what the future holds. 

Drinking Tea and watching the charts!

And it's just the beginning
!!comment!!: Good morning daily! It's Monday morning 9.25 am here in Australia, and I'm dropping by while mining fiat from the office. Right now on an MS Teams meeting. Hope you all have had a great weekend. Will lurk and catch up with everyone later!
!!comment!!: i gotta learn when to take profits before next bull.
!!comment!!: Moons are mooning! If we keep adding use cases we will easily hit $1 and moreüöÄ
!!comment!!: When - not if - MOONS reaches SHIB's current market cap, each moon will be at roughly $92.

Let thatüö∞ in
!!comment!!: Does this pump make sense to you? I mean out of blue we are suddenly up. Can it be a trap before FED meeting?
!!comment!!: 445 days since Bitcoin's all time high. It feels like yesterday yet ages ago at the same time.
!!comment!!: What happened?

I just took a nap and when I woke up, I earned more than working my ass off an entire day.
!!comment!!: Where have all the "we're going below 10k" people gone?
!!comment!!: It‚Äôs already Monday here.

Back to the fiat mines!
!!comment!!: All this Green on the charts are gonna force me to stay awake and look at the charts whole night.
!!comment!!: As the 49ers season dies, Crypto markets rise
!!comment!!: I wonder if we'll hit $24k before the daily closes. Hmm.. 53 minutes to go!
!!comment!!: Imagine where we would be if it wasn‚Äôt for that asshole sbf. Probably well over 32k
!!comment!!: Come on BTC. You can do it boy. Keep pumping.
!!comment!!: The daily is going like in the good old times
!!comment!!: One guy has went from 500 to 1500 tiles in a few hours, with it increasing.  He's minting out everything he can.  How's it going to be with 1 guy owning 30% of the board?

"Bitcoin has now reclaimed its long-term holder cost basis ($22.3k) in addition to its short-term holder cost basis ($18.9k) and the aggregated cost basis. Behavioral shift as holders in aggregate are no longer underwater. 

The last three times this has happened are shown below:"

Bull run confirmed
!!comment!!: I've never cashed out or converted any of my Coinbase Earns. Foolish? Probably.

But from a starting total of $127 in free crypto, their current value is now just under $55.

This is the only indicator I refer back to regarding the market. Everything else is just noise. üòú
!!comment!!: Hope everybody getting to they peace ‚úåÔ∏è on here üí∞
!!comment!!: What kind of server hosting package do you need to keep Moonplace website running for a full 30 minutes uninterrupted? ü§ì
!!comment!!: it‚Äôs nice to see eth finally stretching its legs
!!comment!!: People had MONTHS to buy cheaper BTC, but they waited for a 50% rally to start buying because they wanted to buy at 12k. That‚Äôs why time in the market beats timing the market
!!comment!!: Holy shit, bears are fucked
!!comment!!: /r/buttcoin is on suicide watch
!!comment!!: Good afternoon! 

Looks like crypto is slightly up again today!! Happy. I could get used to this!

!!comment!!: https://i.imgur.com/7C4Jlzp.jpg

guys wth did you doooo?
!!comment!!: Has anyone seen my top hat and monocle? I need to call Forbes for my interview and I want to look the part
!!comment!!: Hopefully these last few pumps can convince some of our fellow holdouts that quite possibly the bottom has come in, who knows but if the bottom did come in Bitcoin is still cheap right now if it keeps pumping atthis Pace in a couple months it won't be.
!!comment!!: and now 16 cents. Good job team behind MoonSpace!
!!comment!!: Ok I haven‚Äôt been on in a long time wth is moonspace
!!comment!!: Come on who is selling 23.3k? Everyone knows 25bp and less hawkish talk is coming next week. Do not let the cramer win.
!!comment!!: Well that pump was extremely short lived
!!comment!!: Don‚Äôt you get penalized for selling moons as in your earning ratio drops?
!!comment!!: Do you guys ever buy directly from trust wallet? Or do you guys go through your regular ways to buy it
!!comment!!: Only 6% unique holders of MoonPlace... A big yikes if your holding these as a speculative investment imo.
!!comment!!: Would it be smart to pay some out now to fund my sidehustle? I‚Äôm in profit, so I would only take the profit part.
!!comment!!: So many items to collect from r/cryptocurrency - moons NFTs and now tiles. Too late to jump on the MoonPlace bandwagon but congrats to everyone who got a tile or two (and then some)!
!!comment!!: Well I hope we've really left the bottom behind, because I don't think I can mentally handle another drop to $17k.
!!comment!!: This rally is eerily similar to the 2019 rally where bitcoin went from 3k to 14k before ultimately going back down. Eerily similar.
!!comment!!: So I tried to find a risky moon coin to make some money on with a dumb leverage gamble (for fun, with a little amount of money, I'm not crazy) over the weekend.

I bottled it and just played it safe with MATIC. Only put a small amount in, but still a happy weekend.
!!comment!!: Anyone staking atom? I only have a low amount, not sure its worth it with the 21 day hold.
!!comment!!: We need to clear these sell walls up to 24k before we can teleport to 30k
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: I am most certainly NOT in the bathtub!
!!comment!!: So it's pump - crab for a week - pump again. Liking this new BTC trend
!!comment!!: To prop up the ponzi, FTX literally dumped millions of stolen tokens on other people liquidating them out of everything they own and I'm seeing some "this rally is price manipulation" on my timeline

The bullshit was the dump, not the rally
!!comment!!: Is it easy to stake your assets on kraken ?
!!comment!!: What is the cheapest exchange to go from crypto to fiat in your bank? So many fees along the way. In US btw
!!comment!!: Crypto is back??? Or fake run?
!!comment!!: Coinbase learning isn't active in my country anymore, it makes me sad.
!!comment!!: It‚Äôs not looking good for the 49ers. 

But it is looking good for Bitcoiners.
!!comment!!: Reddit app was giving me trouble staying logged in. I just nervously Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and successfully recovered my moon vault. Whew!
!!comment!!: Might have to start DCAing more (fomo)
!!comment!!: Almost done with January its been a good month and new year for crypto so far
!!comment!!: Any interesting nft collections worth to get familiar with?
!!comment!!: Remember guys, the most important smart contract is you.
!!comment!!: All this DCAing is paying off üò≠
!!comment!!: I was waiting to buy even lower, so this is probably actually a legit start to a bull run since that's how life works.
!!comment!!: At this rate, Moons are gonna get more mentions in the daily than BTC.
!!comment!!: Wonder if i made the right choice to spend all 600+ MOONS i acquired in a year on moonplace‚Ä¶ üòÖ
!!comment!!: anyone here still invest in atom? I did some dca down over the last year wondering if others still invest in it?
!!comment!!: What a fucking journey. I got into crypto in Feb 2021 when BTC was pushing for 60k for the first time and had been buying ever since. My portfolio was -50% in the red at one point. I continued buying through 2022, and bought even more under 18k. I'm now only -5% in the red as of now. I don't know if things will get bad again, but feels good to know I can keep calm and DCA if it comes to that.
!!comment!!: Sol has been so strong since its bottom below 10
!!comment!!: 70 percent on my exam. I‚Äôll take it.
!!comment!!: Is Litecoins ATH really $420.69?
!!comment!!: I still don‚Äôt trust this pump, the PTSD from 2022 is strong
!!comment!!: Holy shit - we need an anti-ChatGPT filter. This sub is infiltrated!!
!!comment!!: Just happy to see moons going up, won't sell till $10 though
!!comment!!: btc has been resilient against really any re-trace thus far. a lot different than any other time it's pumped during this bear market. obviously anything can happen but this is as bullish as i've been since last november
!!comment!!: Never before have I agonized for hours over how to draw a 50x50 pixel Snorlax so as to not shame my neighbour u/Maleficent_Plankton on Moonplace.

His owl... whatever, thing, looks awesome in the top left.  Crossing my fingers that my boy looks good.
!!comment!!: It‚Äôs pumping timeüéâ the money the bulls made off decimating bears options yesterday is being put to work nowüí™
!!comment!!: All aboard!

!!comment!!: To all the bears who shorted RIP and lol
!!comment!!: People that think this isn't the end of the bear market should really open their eyes and check out the volume

&#x200B;

The other day we hit as much volume on coinbase as when we were breaking 60k
!!comment!!: Wow, what a freaking day! Broke 6k moons and now I'm in the green with CKB. Epic day.

!!comment!!: Is that it? Are we heading back down again? It was nice seeing some green for a change üò¢

-Cant be green forever. Correction days are normal

-No one knows what is going to happen and if they claim to they're full of shit

Key ideas from ‚ÄúInventing Bitcoin‚Äù

- Bitcoin is poised to decentralise the production and consumption of money
- Bitcoin is the first digital system which enforces scarcity without any intermediaries and is the first asset known to mankind whose unchangeable supply and schedule of issuance is known completely in advance 
- The mass media often portrays an image of Bitcoin miners solving complex mathematical equations. That is a fallacy. What they do is to repeatedly roll a giant virtual die to produce a hash within a certain target interval.

Sometimes, stacking sats is a lonesome process, and you may lose sight of your original resolve. Reading ‚ÄúInventing Bitcoin‚Äù for some inspiration. Hope you are recharged as well.
!!comment!!: It's moon day. Even though I've done nothing but hold every moon I've earned and will do nothing different, exciting day
!!comment!!: Gonna have crab for lunch today
!!comment!!: Can I pls get a quick 100x bagger before this whole market collapses?
!!comment!!: My Dad died on 1/2 and it really affected my daily shitposting this month. Lowest moon count since distros started.
!!comment!!: please no one move, dont scare CKB pump. Its a shy one
!!comment!!: I really underperformed this time.
I knew I should have cancelled life in order to get more moons.
Not gonna happen again. 
Breathing should be the only activity allowed apart from moon farming.
!!comment!!: Alright, enough posting. I really need to get back to this math trigonometry homework. See y‚Äôall in 5 mins
!!comment!!: New moons look pretty good on you all ü§©
!!comment!!: Wow that‚Äôs quite the green candle
!!comment!!: I am honestly beginning to think it might be a bull, which probably means everything is about to crash lol
!!comment!!: Bogdanoff : \*heavy breathing\*
!!comment!!: Inverse Cramer comes through again
!!comment!!: I came back seeing BTC still a little below $23k. Read the comments here, actually opened the chart and saw it actually jumped to almost $24k.

The action always happens when I'm away üò≠
!!comment!!: I got just over 3 moons.  No one has more moons than me.  I have the most moons. The best moons.  Everyone knows that.  They look at me and they say, "Now that guy knows moons."
!!comment!!: So far quitting cigarettes about 2 years ago allowed me to buy 1.5ETH with money that would be wasted. I keep it in my wallet and watch it grow every week, .01ETH = 1 pack of smokes
!!comment!!: Being active here is like DCAing, when the bullrun comes, it will be wonderful for moon holders.
!!comment!!: buy more bitcoin everyone and pump it over 25k for me
!!comment!!: I bought BTC yesterday on my birthday, everything‚Äôs falling into place‚Ä¶
!!comment!!: Is it me or do Coinbase fees suck? ‚Ç¨3.84 fee on ‚Ç¨100 purchase. Seems to be fixed regardless of what currency. 

Anyone suggest a cheaper alternative? (Based in Ireland)
!!comment!!: How often can the [**S&P 500 reject from the same damn trendline since all time high**](https://i.postimg.cc/fybkbP2J/S-P500-Trend.jpg)? Crypto would have such a wonderful pump if we go above that one. So many people in the financial world are watching it.
!!comment!!: I hope you all have a great Moon day üòÅ
!!comment!!: Whatever happens, prepare your cheeks
!!comment!!: I love when big moves happen in the market and the daily is alive. Pretty dead recently
!!comment!!: Did my DCA today, quite happy about it, let's see where market goes..
!!comment!!: We were so close to that 1/1 moon/karma ratio. Wonder if we'll hit it next month
!!comment!!: Sweet, finally broke 1,000 moons. üåù
!!comment!!: Had a dream I woke up and BTC was just flying away. Watched it hit $188k before I threw my phone at the wall knowing my short had just been obliterated.

Woke up. Still crabbing around 23k üòÆ‚Äçüí®

!!comment!!: Had my first distro, super happy
!!comment!!: Want to know why the avatars will make it? 

A person was hacked, and lost her favorite avatar‚Ä¶. The artist bought it back and gave it back to her because he knew how much it meant to her‚Ä¶

Yeah. That happened.

!!comment!!: Looks like we might hit 24k today
!!comment!!: It doesn't matter how high it will go if you can't time the local top. What matters is how hard it will correct after and where the next support will be
!!comment!!: First time here in at least a year I'd say. Bitty seems to be in the move.
!!comment!!: Wish  everyone all the big green candles/dildos they are hoping for,. Not because I care about all you lovely people, but if you are getting them, I am also getting them.

!!comment!!: Well that was short lived :/
!!comment!!: Congratulations everyone on the new moons üåïüåïüåï
!!comment!!: I‚Äôm in for the tech again
!!comment!!: Do you think in a few years we will scroll through this sub and wondering how dumb we are for not accumulating more at this price ?
!!comment!!: I feel there is nothing to be afraid of. A lot of long term indicators point at long term trend reversal, on top of the fact that nearly every bear market so far has in bitcoin has ended in roughly 400-450 days. There will be resistance on the way up, but bitcoin getting to 30k levels is inevitable. There's a bunch of shorts going to get liquidated up there.
!!comment!!: hahaha, u/XnoonefromnowhereX promised me 10 moons if I could show him an article painting crypto in a positive light. when I did, he first wrote [this](https://imgur.com/a/l6p2wo7) (it's not even paywalled, lol) and then blocked me before I could answer anything. cool dude, lol
!!comment!!: I was wondering why the Daily was sorted by best, turns out I was on the wrong daily. Dammit Im getting more stupid by the minute
!!comment!!: Watching Djokovic recover from his hamstring and dominate Rublev at the Australian Open and it reminded me how Bitcoin is recovering and regaining its dominance over alts.


*This shitpost was based on style of u/cryotosensei*
!!comment!!: its crazy only 1500 comments so far in the day reminder the days of 60k comments it was like a live chat -.-
!!comment!!: Moons are about to be released. The final ratio is 0.93275.

Congratulations to everyone! Hope you are happy with your Moons.
!!comment!!: Rip in peace all the people that didn‚Äôt buy low because they wanted 12k. Y‚Äôall be remembered
!!comment!!: All hail moons! Whens the next distribution??
!!comment!!: I might have done some stupid mistakes in the last 2 years, but at least I never used leverage or shorts/longs
!!comment!!: Grab the chips fellers, we got some dip.
!!comment!!: 3 weeks of green followed by a red candle 3 days in to the week. Time for some pullback perhaps.
!!comment!!: BTC is holding up well.

Alts not so much
!!comment!!: I hope we stay up. I heard the bears "have screenshots to show" if we get back to 16k. 0\_0
!!comment!!: Hot web 3 gaming take, there is nothing that NFT‚Äôs/blockchain can do for gaming that doesn‚Äôt already exist in the industry or can‚Äôt be made possible by the tools that game devs already have. 

CSGO has a P2P economy that apparently isn‚Äôt possible without a verifiable blockchain lol. Many other games have this as well.

Play 2 Earn is a recipe for disaster in the age of bots and spam accounts.

Not to mention how play to earn games are either copy cats of already successful games, or simply not fun to play.
!!comment!!: Looks like Europes waking up and pulling us slowly back up. Well done guys keep it up.
!!comment!!: DXY is dangerously close to 100, and can try to do a bounce in their support if the fed brings a bit of joy to the USD the next week.

!!comment!!: We going to 25k Bitcoin soon?
!!comment!!: Bears back to your cage... or your: Your position has been liquidated ü§´ü§≠
!!comment!!: USA. Taxes. If I made less than 600 USD on each crypto website, will I not get any 1099 INT? Or will I just not get a 1099 INT at all anyway? 

How does this work? Should I get some kind of crypto tax software?
!!comment!!: I made my bets in the prediction tournament. In the title it's written that there are a lot of prizes like moons, avatars and so on. However I can't find any page with the rules.

I just noticed that I ended up in the 10th position out of more than 6,5k users. That's quite impressive considering it was my first try. I already know that I'll never be so lucky again, so will I get any prize this time or the leaderboard means nothing?
!!comment!!: Good morning from the Uk, may your morning be warmed up by lots of green candles

!!comment!!: One of my recent posts got cross posted to buttcoin and they made fun of me. I feel honored
!!comment!!: Here's an honest opinion, This past month has been a breath of fresh air, at the end of the last run in Dec I cashed out 80% of my portfolio, and staked the other 10% And put 10% into stables.In time this created a -70% hole.In that time from June too now I've managed too get that to -39%.Yesterday I said too myself let's see if it will level out redeemed all my staking rewards, Rose, atom,tezos,osmosis, kusama, Moonriver,and cro.The eth is still sitting where it was 2 years ago.During this rally I've been able too break even.No more 18k hole.Taxres are fucked already but well worth it in my opinion.Toi my fellow patrons I say congrats, even if we go back down too 20, or 19.I think it's safe too say that unless if we get a Mt Gox type event I think we cleared the hump!!!
!!comment!!: All the AI coins are pumping again. Did anyone buy some on the dip?

!!comment!!: Dropping 1k into btc today. Who matching me
!!comment!!: Afternoon, fellas.

I'm new and I'm kind of brain storming how I want to partition my portfolio.  I know about half should be in BTC/ETH... check.  I'm also going to do 15 or 20% MATIC, but I also want 25% of my portfolio to be alt coins with more runway.  I'm NOT necessarily asking for advice on specific coins so much as "sectors" that are worth considering... For example, I want to have at least one WEB3 coin and at least one DeFi coin.

Other than WEB3 and DeFi, what are some other "sectors" that might be worth considering?  AI maybe?

!!comment!!: It's nice seeing all the buying I did in the past 6 months "pay off" (on paper) but I'm definitely not ready for things to pop off too hard. I was hoping to keep buying cheap...it's still cheap, but I mean...I'm just not ready.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Considering all the bullshit that's gone down in the past year (and keeps going, now with Genesis, etc.) the fact that the market is where it;s at right now is pretty remarkable. I don't understand it at all, but it's encouraging! 

Bull trap or no, the fact that a bull trap could even be pulled off in this time is saying something about the relisiency of Bitcoin.

!!comment!!: Atom is carrying my portfolio! Thanks, Atom you‚Äôre a swell guy
!!comment!!: I have to say, watching this sub experience disbelief during this rally after months of shouting "BuT tHe MaCrO" is incredibly entertaining. Even went back to read some old comments like [this one](https://preview.redd.it/ixl5pyqjq43a1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d67db1752ca38ee9e247da13d2f281e15fa9f27). 

Note that $24.5K is likely hard resistance. That is where the 200 week moving average of Bitcoin lies. We already broke that level on the total market cap though! Which I value more.
!!comment!!: NGL I am an at the disbelief psychology stage haha
!!comment!!: I don't know who need to hear this but prices are still darn low if you want to buy. It is not like you missed out because of the past green days so go crazy.
!!comment!!: Good job BTC. Shun the non believers. Shun!
!!comment!!: I literally sold 50% of my crypto dec 30th, then a few days later a massive ralley starts. I can‚Äôt tell you how much this hurts after losing 100% of my crypto to Celsius at the time.

!!comment!!: With this movement, a carton of eggs is back on the menu.
!!comment!!: Even though I bought all I possibly could in the 15-17k range without going completely broke, I still wish I bought more. Worked overtime each week in December, just to buy the dip. And I still wish I bought more.
!!comment!!: My stocks went red but my crypto is green. A win is a win
!!comment!!: So happy, I almost have the energy to do my taxes!
!!comment!!: So if you bought any time in December, you're sitting pretty good right now.

Two and a half months ago I began the reddit moonshots portfolio off a shill post I found on the sub. One project (VRA) is in solid profits (35%). XMR and HBAR are around even. Everything else is at least 20% down

!!comment!!: 23K looks to good on BTC in 2023.
!!comment!!: I wonder how long it will be before my friends that gave me shit for getting into crypto start texting me ‚Äúis now a good time to buy?‚Äù.  I‚Äôm thinking somewhere around $50k-$60k.

!!comment!!: Don‚Äôt let sub sentiment dictate what you do. Do what you‚Äôre comfortable with.
!!comment!!: *Why is Bitcoin pumping?*

Possible reasons:
1. BTC recovering from FTX fallout
2. Cooling of inflation
3. Short sellers getting obliterated 
4. Supply shock due to exodus of people getting their BTC off exchanges 

and how can we forget?
5. Inverse Cramer principle
!!comment!!: 1. Run sentiment analysis on cryptos mentioned in r/CryptoCurrency
2. Find the top negative sentiment coins

!!comment!!: 23k for almost a week, I think it has something to do with it being 2023 now.
!!comment!!: In case anybody cares here‚Äôs some analysis where things might go the next week:

Bitcoin is holding very well after the parabolic short squeeze that surprised everyone. Breaking the 200 MA attracted a lot of traders back fueling even more green. Generally the macro economics are looking better which is the main reason for the 2023 green also clearly visible in the stock market. Inflation being under control is priced in, rate hikes priced in and avoiding a full recession let‚Äôs the market react very euphoric. Economy is still strong same as consumer confidence even after all the rate hikes & inflation.

The problem: chance for a double inflation cycle. The fed knows cooling down to 4-5% YOY ( CPI is a lagging indicator they are already way closer to their 2% goal ) is not sustainable enough therefore it‚Äôs a question how long the rate hikes will stay up until they fully pivot. ( 25BPS is somewhat already a pivot )

Fully pivot means fed basically tells the market they‚Äôll weakening the dollar which can temporary fuel all assets but usually only occurred when things already looked really bad ( which is not the case )

25 BPS rate hike will most likely happen ( almost guaranteed ) and the entire market expects it. If they actually out of nowhere hit it with a 50 BPS you can expect a sharp dump of 6-10% on BTC and across all crypto assets on just the news and more next days.

If the fed is hawkish or has hawkish plans after announcing 25 BPS it‚Äôs gonna be blood similar to the last announcement.

If they actually sound positive after the 25 BPS announcement it could easily lead to a 25k+ BTC and holding that range

!!comment!!: Reading up as much as possible about the Shanghai upgrade. Anything else that will shed insight on my feeble notes? üëá



Popular misconceptions regarding Ethereum‚Äôs Shanghai upgrade 

1. That the proportion of staked ETH will necessarily plunge because people will scramble to unstake their ETH. Knowing that one has the ability to unstake ETH may actually incentivise many investors to continue staking especially since the staking rewards will likely increase after the initial flurry of unstaking.

2. That it will result in a drastic dump in ETH‚Äôs price. However, people neglect that the current staked ETH is only slightly more than 13% of its total supply. Even then, a significant proportion of staked ETH (>60%) is actually relatively liquid since it is staked by one of several liquid staking protocols (Lido, Rocket Pool, Stakewise) or exchanges like Coinbase, Binance & Gemini.

!!comment!!: Someone please help me understand bitcoin. Preferably someone who knows economics well, unlike myself. 

When you ask the question why Bitcoin is worth anything the answer is supply and demand. I understand the supply part: it‚Äôs limited so if it was in demand, then based on supply/demand economics its value would increase. 

But why is there demand for it? I mean consider goat fart. Its supply is limited but it has absolutely no value. Even if there was one goat on the planet that could fart, it wouldn‚Äôt increase the value of goat fart because it‚Äôs goat fart. In fact people may celebrate the death of such a goat because after that all goats on the planet will be non farting goats. 

What is the difference between goat fart and bitcoin?

Alternatively, I could have sent the USD to my bank, waited 3-5 business days.  Meanwhile, give Plaid all of my usernames and passwords so Coinbase can know what stores I shop at.  If my history is insufficient, I have to wait 5-7 more days to wait for the funds to clear.

\- Keep as little on a software wallet as you can, the rest keep on a hardware wallet using a separate address. Transfer from hardware wallet to software wallet as needed  
\-  check every URL. Always check the part closest to the .com or TLD ([foo.uniswap.com](https://foo.uniswap.com) belongs to uniswap for example. uniswap.foo.com does not belong to uniswap). This is really the biggest preventions  
\- Read every transaction and don't do anything if you aren't sure. Some modern wallets (like coinbase wallet) and extensions (like fire) can help tell you exactly the transaction you are making or what you are signing.  
\- Never trust DMs, discord messages, etc... You never have to give out your seed phrase for any reason.  
\- Be careful clicking through anything in an email. It's good practice to manually go to the website yourself if you need to log in for something provided by the email.

Do this and you are 99.99999% safe from hackers, have fun out there but head on a swivel!

!!comment!!: I came 736 in the predictions. How did you all do?
!!comment!!: Oh well. It was fun being slightly less poor for a few days

!!comment!!: Thanks to the recent BTC pump, i learnt two more terms in context: breakthrough & bull trap. I guess we don‚Äôt have to care about which is which though. Just Keep Stacking
!!comment!!: Futures quickly took a turn the other way
!!comment!!: When you staked ETH using binance, you got a wrapped ETH in the form of bETH at a 1:1 ratio.

What happens after Shanghai?  Assuming you want to unstake, do you still have to swap your bETH back to ETH, and if so, will it be at a 1:1 ratio (the current bETH/ETH price is 0.9816)?  


Say you staked 1ETH, will I get back 1ETH plus staking rewards or will I get back 0.9816ETH plus staking rewards? Or will the price of bETH/ETH become 1.0?
!!comment!!: There are 6 million users, but only 6,6K people only. Why so few?

!!comment!!: Am I the only one that is f**king annoyed by u/croa81 ? Only shitposting, posing and harassing people. Please take a look at his comment history in his profile. How is something like that allowed? Reported him like 10 Times and hope you do the same because I don‚Äôt feel someone like him is good for this community or should participate in r/Cryptocurrency

!!comment!!: The ongoing pump is really just a mirror of the stock market recovery.

Global stocks have gained $3.3tn in mkt cap this week thanks to growing evidence of soft landing/mild recession economic scenario, characterized by cooling inflation, non-recessionary growth, & reduced monetary tightening overhang. All stocks now worth $103tn, equal to 106% of US global GDP.

The stock market is on its own pump which cryptocurrency, Bitcoin seems to be still very much linked to.

That said, congrats to anyone who recently bought SOL or AXS!

Every month I buy btc and eth, Last night I bought and transfer them to my trezor, I have whitelisted the adresses. My eth comes through after a few mins, but my btc is still not there. I received confirmation of the withdrawl from CDC, but nothing in my trezor. I see now that the adress I whitelisted and the receive adress are different, even though I have used the exact same before.

So where did the money go and what do I do?

China was a huge holder of Bitcoin and the mining hub of the world, yet when they banned Bitcoin, it did next to nothing to the network. 

Maybe Bitcoin was risky when had a sub $1 billion marketcap, but I just can't see how it would collapse at this point.

!!comment!!: Coinbase scam texts are going bonkers. Got my first one ever this weekend and another one today. Be careful out there
!!comment!!: With the price pumping after the bear market its crazy how quick the "experts" come out of the woodwork shilling their 10x guaranteed moonshot.
!!comment!!: I wonder what happened earlier today. the prices of coins shot up and then dumped them rose up again (to a smaller degree) all in the course of 20 minutes. I guess the random volatility is back
!!comment!!: I only need my portfolio to 5x from here to be whole again after some tough breaks and honestly it seems doable for the first time in a long time

!!comment!!: Hi Crypto Friends! 

I'm Waiting üòÖ for next jump to 24/25k this week.
!!comment!!: Steady whales. Don't kill the 23k now with your 15$ sells
!!comment!!: This battle around 23k has been pretty intense the last few days. I think the bulls eventually take it this week.
!!comment!!: Have to be honest with you,  if we break 23k tonight I'm sure it's not three last chance to buy under 23k
!!comment!!: So, what crypto are you buying these days
!!comment!!: Are we lifting off from now? Or are we going back down?
!!comment!!: If you buy at these prices, your future self will thank you
!!comment!!: I don‚Äôt understand y‚Äôall sometimes. I got talked down so much last year for ‚Äúcatching the falling knife‚Äù but now those same people don‚Äôt wanna buy because ‚Äúlocal top‚Äù

If you‚Äôre one of those people, what‚Äôs your ideal time to buy?
!!comment!!: "Microsoft makes multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT and DALL-E creator, OpenAI"

!!comment!!: Volume is quietly building up
!!comment!!: People want huge gains overnight, but I want to be able to stack in the 20s for a bit longer.
!!comment!!: Stocks are outperforming crypto today. Win - win for me.
!!comment!!: We def about to crash with all this confirmed bull run imminent posts lmao
!!comment!!: What kind of bull run is this? I went to sleep for 4 hours and none of my coins did a 10x üò§
!!comment!!: Right now i'm convinced we are in a huge bulltrap, but Crypto usually does the opposite of what I think it will do, so I might not be so sure anymore.
!!comment!!: Nice week. Lets hope 2023 has many more in store for us.
!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - January 16, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: Only 25% loss on most of my tokens and coins. Not in a bad position. Lets go!
!!comment!!: Looks like ETH is going to $1680 without a pullback. 

Nice.
!!comment!!: I have a few Sneks to hand out. Tell me the last coin you bought
!!comment!!: If your feeling FOMO and thinking this isn‚Äôt a good time to buy after such a massive pump across the board. 

Zoom out, check the monthly chart. Granted, it‚Äôs not as good as it would have been two weeks ago, It‚Äôs still a much better time to buy, than when BTC was at $60k after pumping for two years.

Perspective!
!!comment!!: As long as you made at least one large buy between 15.5 and 17.5k that‚Äôs a win in my book
!!comment!!: Might buy some CAKE to celebrate
!!comment!!: Anyone think we will have a correction any time soon? Back to 17k?
!!comment!!: [deleted]

!!comment!!: 7 days of green candles, when will we üõë
!!comment!!: Just here to say I enjoy seeing your avatars ü•π
!!comment!!: We going for a little pump on this monday evening it seems
!!comment!!: No matter what happens after, it is always joyful to see that crypto is still doing good
!!comment!!: You guys ever think about how funny it is we have daily chats for crypto and stocks? It‚Äôs like if we had a subreddit where we all talk about the weather and what it‚Äôs gonna be like tomorrow and next year and what kind of clothes we need to buy.
!!comment!!: C/D: The bull run is back.
!!comment!!: So far so good holding 21K range
!!comment!!: Happy to see some green days
!!comment!!: Good thing about crypto is it‚Äôs even open on MLK day
!!comment!!: My avg for Eth is now sub 2k‚Ä¶ thank you DCA. We will see if this pays off
!!comment!!: Dude.....Coinbase took off the average price per a token so now we are back to doing math like peasants. 

First songbird.....now delayed flare.....now I godda do maths?

Relist XRP.
!!comment!!: Waiting for BTC to pump to $21.5K so I can take profits from daytrading
!!comment!!: I finally mustered up the courage to go see buttcoin today. You know, to see the other sides arguments‚Ä¶ It really is just a bunch of people who got wrecked because of their paper hands and are still angry about their choices. Someone should keep an eye on those people. I feel sorry for them.
!!comment!!: I don‚Äôt talk about crypto with people and this is a good reason why. 

Guy at work (dudes unhinged) was saying his buddy told him to invest in bitcoin, and he lost 18k and now wants to kill him.
!!comment!!: Bears cant even fathom another 15% move, let alone a true bear market rally. Bears are truly sick creatures that will give back all of their profits per usual
!!comment!!: My portfolio is up 3% after I DCA‚Äòd for 6 month. Is this financial independence?
!!comment!!: Markets barely green but crypto hella green. Love to c it üòç
!!comment!!: Hey yo captain Jack bring us 22k Bitcoin back
!!comment!!: Who‚Äôs still here from November 2017??? What a time.
!!comment!!: FOMO'd into crypto in October '21. I was so happy the first 1,5 months, saw my investment reaching 156%. Then the bear run started. At the lowest, I was at -81,25%.

Luckily I was able to DCA some extra money. That brought me back to -58% of my total investment. With the recent gains, I'm currently sitting at -50%.

If my bag of coins reaches their ATH again, this should bring me to 450%, but I think I will DCA out my initial investment once I reach 200%.

Just wanted to share this, as patience hopefully pays out.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Just took some profits. Pray for me boys
!!comment!!: Wow another green dildo. All this green seems suspicious.

!!comment!!: Does anyone know how to earn some free Crypto nowadays besides Moons? 

Coinbase Learn and Earn is dissapointing lately.
!!comment!!: As great George Constanza once said "Everybody's doing something. We'll do nothing." That's my approach for everything, including crypto
!!comment!!: The coins are finding stability right now
!!comment!!: Am I the only one that doesn‚Äôt mind a quiet day every now and again? 

We‚Äôve made some big (positive) moves over the last week or two, nothing bad with crabbing for a bit to stabilise for the next potential leg up.
!!comment!!: We're at 21k!!! Another green day
!!comment!!: ATOM is holding the line for the #20 spot
!!comment!!: Feels good over here with some dopium  hitting your brain after all the drama of recent months
!!comment!!: BTC just keeps going up. Amazing.
!!comment!!: And another day where BONK is far away from the entry price of most FOMO buyers. I‚Äôm glad I sat this one out.
!!comment!!: So not only holding ground - we‚Äôre going up. Hmm.
!!comment!!: This thing needs to shoot up to 30k already
!!comment!!: Bears are acting like a jealous Ex . 
 Shakira please let it go he already moved on , dis tracks ain‚Äôt gonna stop BTC breaking 22k
!!comment!!: Are we due a correction at this point? What are your thoughts?
!!comment!!: Mother told me to stop buying months ago. Fortunately for me, she also didn‚Äôt raise a quitter. Moral of the story, if you don‚Äôt listen to your parents you will make money.
!!comment!!: Snap shot already in 2 days..I'm thinking the ratio will be in the lower .6 region
!!comment!!: WE SHALL NEVER GO DOWN AGAIN!!!
!!comment!!: Is it sad I'm excited to only be down about 26% on my crypto investments right now?
!!comment!!: Working out and watching at these prices gives you an extra boost for sure.
!!comment!!: I did not expect Bitcoin to go up so fast but I am not complaining. I saw people calling for BItcoin at 10k or even lower.
!!comment!!: Why the hell is Binance still having USTC listed while its price is at $0.02 or so. Isn't it time to take that scam off the exchange??
!!comment!!: Me sa jajar binks me thinks the bitcorn pump not over
!!comment!!: What they want:

A pullback to $19K

What they will get:

A giant green dildo
!!comment!!: Damn.  Portfolio is almost break even.  Worked hard to get all my averages down the last year.
!!comment!!: ETH looks to be going towards $1700, glad I bought as much as I can sub 1200
!!comment!!: 21k breached, 23k is the magic number. Above 23.8k and it's likely a pump all the way up to 28k.

Above that, and the bull could be back on.
!!comment!!: Right now Bears are acting like some Arab football team trying to stop Ronaldo from scoring . 

22k here we come
!!comment!!: Bears are the ones increasingly in fear mode now.

I know the feeling, I've been in that position before. When you think the market will dip lower, and wait to buy (like waiting for $14K or $10K), and then instead it suddenly rallies.

Then you expect it's just a fake pump, and it will correct right back, but hours go by, then days. And you start to get nervous.

You hope stocks will dip, or Feds will say something hawkish, CPI will go back up, GDP will go back down, or oil prices will go back above $100. But none of those are happening.

Or you wait for good old "bloody sunday". And nothing happens.

Then you start to really worry that FOMO is setting back in. And maybe even if there is a correction, it's unlikely to dip lower to $14K,  or even a new low, and may not even return to $16K.
!!comment!!: Great and green day to all!
!!comment!!: Well cheers to fiat mining this week lol
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Finally catching a pump live!

!!comment!!: I named this Jim Cramer bull market
!!comment!!: Just stay above 21K and we‚Äôll be good
!!comment!!: I can't believe $FTT is up 152% over the last 7 days. If crypto wasn't so full of degenerate gamblers, we'd come together as a community at large to destroy the value of coins like that which are literal representations of everything that is wrong with crypto. Needs to be taken out back and shot. Same with $BNB. Same with any exchange token that exists.
!!comment!!: Wow, it really feels like 2021. Please tell me this is real and not an illusion. I don't want to go under 20k again. It feels so good here.
!!comment!!: It feels weird that I can now add eggs to my ramen. It's like I'm a new person, one day I'm eating plain ramen and the next I am adding an egg? Is this what winning feels like? At this rate, I'll be adding kimchi in no time.

!!comment!!: If BTC goes to 20k, I'm having a hot dinner tonight
!!comment!!: Bitcoin dominance increasing. Altcoin prices are increasing in dollars, but decreasing against bitcoin. At this point purchasing btc instead of altcoins is a no brainer: not only it's increasing quicker, but also if we go back to the bear, it will fall slower.

Keep safe and stack sats.
!!comment!!: Feeling FOMO? Try my simple trick of having your wife take everything in the divorce, it's working for me!

Now all you hear from them today is, "Oh, we printed too much money the last 13 years. Too much QE, stock buy backs bad, and tax cuts led to the situation we are in today. We should've never done this! Bad, bad, bad."

If they weren't such paid shills, they would've spoken up back then instead of pump an imaginary market, but now it's too late because things are going to get progressively worse this year. But I'm sure many of them already cashed out their over inflated chips.

Don't ever get sucked in by these fuckers. Fuck em!
!!comment!!: I just sold a good bit. Pump incoming
!!comment!!: PPI data today at 13.00 UTC. 

Probably will dictate pump continuation or a pull back.

!!comment!!: Never heard of bitsllotto
!!comment!!: This US DOJ announcement was a nothing burger IMO.  Don't know this guy or exchange at all but if he was truly a bad actor, glad he's gone.
!!comment!!: While this reveal was quite lame, it was also one of the most level headed descriptions of enforcement within the crytpto space I have ever heard from US LEO's. They identified a bad actor, and removed them as is their job. No getting on a pedestal. Good on them.
!!comment!!: Welp, that could‚Äôve been an email

!!comment!!: There's a 95% chance that this announcement is nothing.
!!comment!!: Sounds partially too like the DOJ and US Government have accepted the fact that cryptos are here to stay. Whether or not they regulate them further is a different question. They just don't want criminals to ruin the rest of those acting in good faith in the crypto markets
!!comment!!: Such a slow month for me. If I get 150 moons, I'm lucky.

"when there was only one set of footprints, that was when bitcoin was carrying your portfolio."

!!comment!!: It‚Äôs up to the old investors to teach newer ones not to buy into times like this where Bitcoin dominance is just now beginning to increase to bear market norms. No I‚Äôm not talking about anyone who joined in 2021 but those who have been here during previous bear markets.

Just look at what this recent dip did to some altcoins. Bitcoin was only down 2% today and some coins dropped 10%. Can you imagine what will happen to them if we test 19,18, 17k? Suddenly those partnership headlines don‚Äôt mean so much because this is all just a game. Trade and let the next fool hold your garbage.

The only reason you should be buying alts right now is to trade them on pumps, but you have people saying they‚Äôre not good day traders‚Ä¶what did you do when you saw your coin up 50%? You didn‚Äôt sell because greed told you that it‚Äôs too early. But greed also caused you to whip out your wallet on a 2% dip.

Don‚Äôt throw away your money.

Would be great to let me know how to post. Here is my post in full

\---

Title: I traded bitcoin since 2012 and I think the bear market is not over

Since I experienced the 2014 and 2017 bear markets (and a small part of even earlier bitcoinica bear market), this is what I observed:  
The majority of the market participate invested not because they RESUMED confidence after a bear market.  
They do so because they either didn't know the previous bear, or have forgotten about it.  
After Mt Gox and during the 400-day bear market proceeding it, I have not often see an investor buying bitcoin because they think modern CEX are better managed than MtGox, or the fundimental was not harmed by MtGox so they should resume confidence. No - such happens rarely.  
Overwhelmingly, they invest because either never heard of MtGox or have completely forgotten about it. That's why they dared to invest.  
There is a pattern: bull market returned not because bad sentiment "turned" good. It's because bad sentiment is "forgotten", or market participants are too new to have experienced it.  
Now two things prevents new, non-leveraged sustainable force to join the market.  
First, the memory of FTX and other failed projects are too recent. Mt Gox was the leading reason of 2014 bear market, but this bear market started uneventful and lasted a year before FTX collapsed. The bad sentiment is too recent.  
Second, there lack new market participants who have never heared of the prevoius bad stories. Most people who bought Bitcoin in 2016 never heard MtGox during its collaps in 13-14 and most who bought in 2020 never heard Ethereum during its crash in 17-18. Today due to high participation rate, few are oblivious.

!!comment!!: Here we go again...I'm all in SMH!
!!comment!!: ETH holding $1500 is great.  Every day we go without a freefall feels like it‚Äôs building pressure to add buy orders and drive price up.
!!comment!!: If we hit ATHs again, y‚Äôall selling or hodling?
!!comment!!: What happened to the user 'bad_crypto_advice' ? 

He always knew what to do in a market like this.

!!comment!!: Against my better judgement, I‚Äôm going to buy more.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: I‚Äôm up like 30% in the past 2 weeks!!!

!!comment!!: I realise that when my plate is packed to the brim with work, just getting one thing done on my to-do list - even if the deadline is not urgent - helps make me feel at peace and at ease. Which explains why I am shitposting this rn
!!comment!!: Out of curiosity, want to know what ya'lls sentiments on some old/new favorites are.

This last week the mood of the people has been one of quiet contemplation, an awakening.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

Or we could have had a few people splashing their xmas cash I don't know.
!!comment!!: Whenever I see some shit like BONK do well, I realize there is a lot of money out there for a new bull run.
!!comment!!: BTC really wants to push above that 20k threshold into the 21 range.

!!comment!!: Nice to see more activity on this sub again. Always more exciting being able to interact with more people
!!comment!!: When you buy a shitcoin called Internet Computer and it gives you profit.Instead of selling you become slowly attached to it and get greedy...... Some things never change

!!comment!!: Looks like we're either going up or down now. Follow me for more TA.
!!comment!!: Not sure if we have seen the bottom. But glad to see some relief in the market
!!comment!!: Life's starting to feel back to normal
!!comment!!: I think it might be a tad too early for another bullrun and wanted to accumulate some more but if you guys want one i don't mind
!!comment!!: When BTC reaches 100k, not saying it will be anytime soon, we should have a cryptocurrency reddit party paid with moons. All invited.
!!comment!!: The best feeling is when a coin you own is pumping

!!comment!!: 1 profit in hand is worth 2 in the bush
!!comment!!: For anyone that has Mexc account check your wallets. Free $5 airdrop today. It‚Äôs not much but could get u some cheap crypto
!!comment!!: I really hope AMP does something cool someday so I can quit my job and build weird shit all day.
!!comment!!: I dont understand why people are so surprised Bitcoin (and therefore alts) rallied. Bitcoin has never been more correlated to the stock market \[only exception: FTX collapse\].

What has the stock market done? Well:

* Dow Jones retraced almost 70% of the fall since all time high
* S&P 500 retraced almost 40% of the fall since all time high
* Nasdaq has retraced over 60% of the fall since all time high

These facts combined should make it not that surprising that crypto rallies. If anything, we should have done so much earlier, but FTX likely ruined the party. Even the DXY has been dumping hard. Bitcoin ALWAYS rallies when the DXY dumps hard.
!!comment!!: Why is FTX token pumping? Isn‚Äôt this a scam exchange? What‚Äôs wrong with people?
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: This correction kills my erection
!!comment!!: This feels like a pump and dump by the big players...

I'm going to hold back, too much shit going on in the world for a crypto bull run.
!!comment!!: my inner thoughts: hehe I'm gonna call it a 'bull trap' so everybody thinks this guy knows what's happening lol
!!comment!!: Just keep staking, just keep staking! - Dory
!!comment!!: I‚Äôve been in Crypto since 2017 I‚Äôve seen many bull traps , here is why this one is not one of them: 

1- usually the first dump is a huge one <5-10% after that‚Äôs it keeps going lower and lower 

2-it‚Äôs highly difficult to buy back bull traps as the sell wall amount are way higher
!!comment!!: The next 21k battle round is about to start
!!comment!!: When BTC turns 21, drinks on me üç∫
!!comment!!: Asia should pamp this shit up
!!comment!!: I‚Äôm drunk. Crypto be reet
!!comment!!: Back to crabbing now at these prices, or do we get to enjoy some green in our portfolio until they all dump again next week?
!!comment!!: Fucking John Wick in the charts again
!!comment!!: Does daily always get a snek?
!!comment!!: Some very green days upon us. How many of ya actually up right now? Or most of ya still upside down from late '21/early '22? Did you spend the last several months averaging down some or fear keep ya out of the market?

!!comment!!: Seems like a decade ago when I used to wake up to 100% gains on coins. I hope to see those days again.
!!comment!!: How you plan to spend your Sunday ?
!!comment!!: Massive pump from 16940 to 16950!
!!comment!!: Nice. Only -66% on my ADA now!
!!comment!!: The current sentiment from this price action shows how desperate we are for a recovery.  Like finally getting a piece of tail after being locked up for a decade.
!!comment!!: The 100th Sunday of DCA. What an experience it's been
!!comment!!: Just noticed that it‚Äôs my 5yr cake day. 

Some advice, avoid shitcoins and buy BTC & ETH.
!!comment!!: Signed a malicious contract and it took all my eth from my wallet. Any way to revoke the transaction?
!!comment!!: ADA showing some life this morning
!!comment!!: Is this my birthday-pump?! Wow! Nice present, thanks.
!!comment!!: Wish u a great sunday folksüëåüöÄ
!!comment!!: Do you all think we see 10k BTC at any point of this bear market?
!!comment!!: Hope you guys had a great start in the year
!!comment!!: OpenSea now supports Arbitrum Nova on their platform! FYI u/tmztmz2
!!comment!!: Bloody Hell.  Why did nobody tell us that AI coins were gonna perform well this year?
!!comment!!: Hello cryptoland, how are we doing today?
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Nice to see ADA up nearly 20% since the start of 2023!
!!comment!!: Weekend is over for me unfortunately. Another week of grinding in the fiat mines but a bit closer to the next bull run I guess
!!comment!!: I'm gonna through VET out a mention just cause I still love it.
!!comment!!: What a huge pump we're up almost a percent. Time to mortgage the house and go all in. The bull run is back üöÄ üöÄ
!!comment!!: Cramer signal is realized. This is bull. Prepare for lambo.
!!comment!!: Volume so low I'm gonna need some subtitles
!!comment!!: I'm guessing we crab slowly upwards until the next round of  bad news - DCG/Genesis/Silvergate/layoffs/closures and or rate hikes. I base that on nothing but a guess.
!!comment!!: Beautiful cold breezy but Warm Sunday Morning this is, happy sunday everyone.

 Hope we will see some solid green soon üíö.
!!comment!!: I know it‚Äòs just a drop on the hot stone but at least ADA is showing some strength
!!comment!!: Damn, I wasn‚Äôt noticing but ADA is up nearly 15% in last 5 days. Not bad considering everything going on in the market.
!!comment!!: Patiently waiting for more pain.
!!comment!!: Afternoon all.
How's everyone?
!!comment!!: GALA hell yes. I don't want to curse anything but  hoping for a comeback.
!!comment!!: Since everyone thinks this rally will fail, I think we are going to break out. Shorters will get rekt and the cycle will restart
!!comment!!: Looks like we‚Äôre heading back to 16.7k again ü¶Äü¶Ä
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: Slowly taking the stairs up on the BTC 7D chart
!!comment!!: I just hope that people (including me) persist long enough with crypto to see their pains finally pay off and make the suffering worthwhile.
!!comment!!: SAND is pumping. Now I am only 93.5% down on my investment. whoohoo
!!comment!!: Since CPI is this week, and I anticipate a lower number, I went ahead and bought some more BTC. That being said, that buy just put me officially at my bear market goal.
!!comment!!: Boy these candles are greener than Shrek's asshole and im loving it
!!comment!!: It's so crazy to me that when BTC is at an all time high, this sub is booming and people are buying. They were saying "man, you were lucky to buy BTC at <20k"

But when the price is much lower and actually <20k, it's a ghost town and those people aren't buying. Makes no sense lol.

I have friends who wouldn't stop talking about BTC when it was at ATH and they were buying, but now that it's on sale they wont touch it and don't really talk about it. Like wtf, people should be buying right now more than ever. 

I just envision those inflatable flailing arm advertising droids waiving like crazy and it's just me and 5 other dudes lined up to buy.
!!comment!!: Crypto is going to pump up violently imo. If a nuke down were coming it should‚Äôve been catalyzed by bearish ftx/dcg/silvergate news.

All the selling absorbed. Volatility hitting 2018 lows. Just shove your $ in with no leverage and pray imo.
!!comment!!: Hello the new daily! So quiet here!
!!comment!!: We were above 17k for 5 seconds

!!comment!!: Have a question for the people with platinum tier and changed their flair how can you do this?
Never got a message with the perks that come with platinum can someone explain what you can do with it and how

Thanks in advance
!!comment!!: Dumb question of the day. How can a crypto price be trending up when the volume is lower?
!!comment!!: Remember how some in this sub were buzzing about Apecoin? Where did they all go?
!!comment!!: where's the best place to keep track of all the dot parachains?
!!comment!!: Somehow i feel the $DOT parachain slot auction was a flop. Opinion?
!!comment!!: (I know it's against reddit TOS) but I want to swap my moons for Nano but now I can't cause I can only send them to other users instead of other wallets like I used to. What do I do
!!comment!!: Weekends used to lead to exciting crypto price action. Now it‚Äôs completely flat. I guess retail really is mostly gone
!!comment!!: Apparently, El Salvador's Bitcoin‚ÄØcity will be free of income, property, and capital gains taxes. But is this sustainable? Where will it‚Äôs revenue come from to cover infrastructure and other gov costs?
!!comment!!: Hi üëã daily fam. It‚Äôs Sunday night and bedtime here in Australia. Back to fiat mining tomorrow. Will be working from home as kids still on holidays. Lots of online meetings. Should have plenty of opportunity to lurk and watch the charts. Take care everyone and have a great week!
!!comment!!: I feel like big movements might come soon , cuz this silence doesn't feel right
!!comment!!: Good Afternoon from a sunny Europe. The crabbing continues, which at least means that my portfolio is substantially worth more compared to some months ago as the DCA doesnt isntantly evaporate lol
!!comment!!: does anyone else think that this sub is a nicer place now all the scams finally imploded and wipped out the moonboys?
!!comment!!: I see ADA is recovering, I knew I shouldn't have given up on it. I will continue holding my bag
!!comment!!: Besides BTC, what else are you all buying right now?
!!comment!!: Dont worry friends.

Everything is going to be alright... *someday*
!!comment!!:  First Sunday of the new year.  Will we see the return of the Bloody Sunday streak?  Or will *this time be different*?
!!comment!!: You might want a lambo, I just want a bunch of cans of beans.
!!comment!!: is it safe to come out guys?
!!comment!!: Yeah we ain‚Äôt breaking past that $17k resistance anytime soon .. it‚Äôs been unfazed everytime we touch $17k
!!comment!!: We touched 17K for a while, and now back to crabbing just below it for the remainder of the day.
!!comment!!: Volume so flat the last 24 hrs that the couple hundred $ candle looks enormous.
!!comment!!: Is there some problem with Binance? Mate just messaged me to transfer everything out of it
!!comment!!: And yet again i wait for a dump and the market keeps going up couldve had 3 cheaper buy ins
!!comment!!: There was a moment where we were approaching 6 million members in here and it seemed close. Now I feel like the numbers are going down‚Ä¶ Seems like people are bored and don‚Äôt wanna bother being in here. Sure things are slow but there‚Äôs still a huge community and I always enjoy the crypto discussion in here even if most of it is bullshit. Gotta take the bad with the good
!!comment!!: Feels weirdly refreshing to see some alts having a little run up though it most likely wont last
!!comment!!: Looking more and more likely we‚Äôll break 17k resistance
!!comment!!: Prices on CDC seem to be consistently slightly higher than on CB
!!comment!!: RIP to those who tried shorting Gala yesterday üôè
!!comment!!: Do we expect a bad day Tuesday following the Fed meeting?

!!comment!!: And there was much rejoicing.
!!comment!!: Good morning from Australia! It‚Äôs a nice Green Day and a great start to 2023!!! Mining fiat from home today. Slow day will spend some time with the kids who are still on holidays. See you all later!
!!comment!!: I love how times have been so bad that like a 1-4% jump gets us absolutely ecstatic.
!!comment!!: Oh wow the charts are giving me dopamine!!! It feels amazing!!!! This is just the start?
!!comment!!: Scary to see so much green in my portfolio, I'm not used to it üò≠
!!comment!!: One day closer until the next bull run

We're gonna make it!
!!comment!!: Another day, another daily.
!!comment!!: New daily :) less than 10 ppl here
!!comment!!: Damn it's quiet here!ü§´ Quiet or you'll wake everyone up!!
!!comment!!: ADA just grinding to the upside ü§©
!!comment!!: Usually when ADA pumps, BTC decides to crash and ruin the party. Lets see how this plays out
!!comment!!: haha I really can't catch any crypto luck. Used the little bit of BTC that I cashed out from before I got wrecked..and the new year starts using that to buy a ssd drive that Amazon said they delivered when they didn't.
!!comment!!: The one thing that has been predictable in crypto lately has been the crabby weekends.
!!comment!!: What do you guys think the dopest raspberry pi crypto project is?
!!comment!!: Tezos up 10+% on the 1 week chart üëÄ
!!comment!!: Marking exam papers, completing an online course, doing some data entry and preparing for a return to work tomorrow. Yes, I'm a leave everything to the last minute person
!!comment!!: The cycling subs are taking over my feed. Good sign I suppose.
!!comment!!: Serious question: are many things in crypto pretty complicated to handle for "normies" because the builders are in kind of a bubble of devs & nerds, thus what seems easy and obvious to them is to complex for others?
!!comment!!: I came back to crypto after half a year... looks like I really can't escape
!!comment!!: I really miss the days of making a ridiculous amount of money on a daily basis by farming in ponzi dex's across multiple chains.
!!comment!!: Wow.  Much quiet in crypto land.  Clock just ticked over to Sunday here in PST.  How‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs Sunday going?
!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - January 17, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: Day 7 of fiat mining in 2023 and not a single day I‚Äôm not exhausted. So much work.

But good to see the green vibes in crypto lately.
!!comment!!: Really bummed I had to sell my moons. Hopefully I can accumulate more in a month for not to much more

Do you think Bitcoin alone or cryptocurrencies should be incorporated into college education?
!!comment!!: One day closer to owning my own home. üçª

In crypto I trust!
!!comment!!: I'm so thankful that I live in a time when something is booming and I am here for the ride.

To be able to buy some free time is all I ask for, this 9-5 bullshit isn't getting me anywhere.
!!comment!!: Btc Struggling to get over the 21.3k from early November. Lets do this.
!!comment!!: dollar stopped dumping and stabilised, stocks stopped the pump, new floor price for BTC at $21k

Clever.
!!comment!!: Eth has been carrying my entire portfolio. What a beast.
!!comment!!: Jim Cramer is seeing bullish signs for the stock market, so that means the run is over soon I guess.
!!comment!!: I don't dream of becoming a millionaire. It's enough for me to get my initial investment back
!!comment!!: Is it safe to get out of the coma?
!!comment!!: My stocks are outperforming my crypto today. I guess that's a good thing.
!!comment!!: If we can only get a small Asian pump tonight‚Ä¶
!!comment!!: Just one day to go, any predictions for moons ratio folks?
!!comment!!: What time is the snapshot guys?
!!comment!!: Watch us keep going up while while stocks crash this year. Almost certainly if they go down hard, then we will go down hard, but it's a nice thought.
!!comment!!: People didn‚Äôt buy at 15k because they wanted to buy lower. Same with 16 and 17k. Now with 21k. They will always wait to buy lower and end up buying at ATH
!!comment!!: Last 2 cycles we‚Äôve had a double bottom before the bull run started. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see that kind of structure again in the coming year
!!comment!!: Just let it happen bears. Stop fighting.
!!comment!!: I cannot wait to be financially independent with crypto and lose all my money on stocks
!!comment!!: I see ETH ending this year in $7000-10,000 range. Smart contract growth is about 150% each month and there is no more selling pressure from miners.
!!comment!!: Green days have come again
!!comment!!: Algo squaring off before the next big jump.
!!comment!!: mining stocks like MARA and heavily shorted ones like CB should run this week
!!comment!!: BTC at 21k making me feel like I don't need my morning coffee
!!comment!!: We are consolidating nicely and resetting the RSI levels. Next move up soon? 
Lets see how the Us Markers will do today.
!!comment!!: Futures down slightly, let's see how markets look later this morning.
!!comment!!: I love when buttcoiners have so much confidence in everything they say, such as: ‚ÄúThis pump only happened because Binance printed 6B USD out of thin air‚Äù

I wish I had this much confidence in everything I say in life
!!comment!!: Goodnight all from Australia ‚ù§Ô∏èüíö‚ù§Ô∏èüíö i havent been that active but ive been enjoying the pumps
!!comment!!: Very bullish sentiments across the board
!!comment!!: Was expecting a bit of red this morning but so far it‚Äôs holding the line.
!!comment!!: It seems like bitcoin is about to take off but‚Ä¶ Cramer has officially death kissed this rally‚Ä¶
!!comment!!: There‚Äôs Lugano, Switzerland, and Bitcoin Beach El Salvador, and Bitcoin Island Philippines. If you had a choice, which part of the world do you want to see turned into a BTC haven?
!!comment!!: Wishing you all a great week ahead üôå
!!comment!!: I was promised blood. Instead, I have received crabs.
!!comment!!: Hoping for a pullback to blast us off like a slingshot
!!comment!!: Casper had a big pump. Binance listing rumours I guess.
!!comment!!: We haven't been this much above the bull market support band since March 2022 when we went to 48k and dropped to 39k and the second last time was during ATH
!!comment!!: New daily in t minus 15 minutes
!!comment!!: [Packs your bags](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmpyTx8X0AAtB0o?format=jpg&name=4096x4096), guys and girls. Jim Cramer ruined us.
!!comment!!: Definitely a quieter day today than I expected! The stock market stayed pretty flat and crypto pretty much stayed around the weekend levels. Nice to still see BTC at 21k after last weeks rally!
!!comment!!: 2022 survivors - are we pretty much numb to any downward price movement?

I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs always the potential for major dumps and/or slow and steady bleeds like we saw last year, but at this point, it‚Äôs more like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just buy more‚Äù rather than üò±
!!comment!!: Cramer seeing bullish signs forming in the stock market

Inverse cramer rule kicks in. 

Might be in for a surprise now
!!comment!!: Whale investors do not appear to be selling into the bitcoin rally, a sign of increasing confidence.

Edit: Annnd it's back *happy face*
!!comment!!: My one biggest mistake was VeChain, should have just stuck to Bitcoin/ETH
!!comment!!: CB card renewed 4% xlm rewards for another month...I'll take it!

!!comment!!: Don't be affected by the noise. 

Ignore it and stay on course.

DCA & chill.
!!comment!!: I think we will crab through the night
!!comment!!: I thought something would happen today but guess not. Damn crabs.
!!comment!!: Very slow day in here today‚Ä¶ might not even break 1.5k comments
!!comment!!: I have some BNB in Trust Wallet and I want to exchange to BTC and maybe a little XMR. Would anyone happen to know of a good guide I can follow?
!!comment!!: I‚Äôm proud to say that the only crypto I‚Äôve been shilling in the sub during the bear is performing so well
!!comment!!: It finally stopped being boring
!!comment!!: The world is gonna üöÄüåôafter the US shows yet again what a shitcoin the USD is this week
!!comment!!: - Inflation is too high in my country!
- government removes the vat for the basic products.
- grocery companies push a +20% in the price because less taxes doesn't need to mean less price. And a bit more because why not?
- government increases the income taxes because you can't collect less while airdropping money ad infinitum.
- extra: somehow the official cooked inflation number goes down.
!!comment!!: So, during the lead up to Christmas, I‚Äôm at my local shopping centre and I find one of those pop-up stalls that had hundreds of different led neon light signs.  There were a lot of Disney characters a few marvel, many fancy car brand logos, Xbox/Ps logos etc but what surprised me was the ETH logo. What surprised me more was the XRP logo! I looked for a long time, but didn‚Äôt recognise any other crypto logos. Is crypto now so mainstream that it ranks up there with Mickey Mouse, Captain America‚Äôs shield and Mercedes?
!!comment!!: I was expecting we‚Äôd be dumping by now. Amazed how long this green has gone on for. Kinda bullish
!!comment!!: Was able to work on editing a presentation during a dreaded work meeting. Although this meant that I couldn‚Äôt shitpost then, the sense of liberation I derived from finishing the presentation meant that I am surfing the sub stress-free now. Happy end of fiat day!
!!comment!!: -90%: I'm calm

!!comment!!: BTC around 21k since 3 days, any suggestions for next position?

Edit: this is for ETH staking
!!comment!!: Guess i'll keep on staking until steak!
!!comment!!: I am predicting a quick dip when the markets open.  We will see how the rest of the day reacts.
!!comment!!: Avax running. When will my boy algo run up like that
!!comment!!: Crazy that bitcoin has gone up for 14 straight days. Trailing the record by one day
!!comment!!: Been on the fence about buying back into AVAX for a week I feel like I'm too late. I'm gonna hold long-term but I feel like it's dumb to do it after such a fast pump.
!!comment!!: *And we can build this dream together*

*Standing strong forever*

*Nothing's gonna stop us now*

*And if this world runs out of hodlers*

*We'll still have each other*

*Nothing's gonna stop us*

*Nothing's gonna stop us now*
!!comment!!: My bags haven't moved for a month. Defeating the urge to chase pumps is harder than quitting smoking
!!comment!!: Link has been bleeding against Eth for more than 50 days in a row, a +30% in the ratio. Guess that the staking for very few has been a bit disappointing.

One less to check to swings for a while
!!comment!!: BitBoy is saying we will easily go to 30K within 45 days. 

God, I hate him.
!!comment!!: I'm not impressed by the bears, seems like they're struggling to even get below 21k

Not only is he in hot water for CryptoZoo, he's got abandonment issues too and not in that sense.

"In 2018 Logan Paul adopted a pig Pearl. Recently Pearl was found in an abandoned field nearly dead with mangled ears. She's now safe at an animal sanctuary thanks to the kindness of strangers."

I appreciate it's not flat out Crypto News but this guy is surely becoming the worst person of decade?!

!!comment!!: do you strongly believe a lot of alts will die off in the next run? i‚Äôm not talking about complete shit coins? because i am 50% alts and 25%btc 25%eth and i really don‚Äôt know if should convert to btc and eth and start re buying alts. i‚Äôve calculated if all my coins were to hit ATH again i would have around $25K but if i convert to either btc or eth i would have $20K at their ATH

!!comment!!: If you see a random nft in your wallet, don‚Äôt click it, it‚Äôs scam.
!!comment!!: Just saw this headline in a rival sub. A very interesting fact and a good one for crypto if true -

almost 78% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total circulating supply is illiquid. This leaves less than 22% of all mined BTC on exchanges. The metrics show that investors have been storing BTC in their custodial wallets and avoid selling.**15 million BTCs** are now held in self-custody. This is extremely good.
!!comment!!: So now that we know Busd was partially backed for some time, anyone else find it extremely shady that binance converted everyone's stables to Busd without their consent?
!!comment!!: Man oh man we are really teasing $900B in MCap across the crypto space. What a weird day of trading in trad markets too. One meme stock is up 118% on the day. Insane.
!!comment!!: So we back to "what we buying now" mode? I really missed that
!!comment!!: Another day, another DCA. Not concerned about how the market looks. Just sticking to what I know works
!!comment!!: I don't know who needs to hear this, but include BTC in your DCA, even if it's just a little. 

I know too many people who only DCA into alts and don't bother with BTC because they don't feel they can make the same gains. This is a mistake.
!!comment!!: I fully blame Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic for spoiling the fun with his comments. Can't wait for Thursday though. The next few weeks are going to be big!

!!comment!!: 
You are aware of the Fear and Greed Index but do you know the Bitcoin Misery Index? It is an index that measures Bitcoin‚Äôs price action using a range of 0 to 100. The score is derived by using the percentage of winning trades to total trades and volatility. As such, scores below 27 may spell doomsday and induce ‚Äúmisery‚Äù for existing investors, but may signal buy opportunities for new investors. 

*Do you use the BTC Misery Index in your decision-making process?*

!!comment!!: Who want award? Daily is so empty, so lets make it spice:)
!!comment!!:  I'm really hodl'ing to the moooon.
!!comment!!: Congrats to those who got Bonk early but what goes up rapidly usually falls rapidly too.
Looks like a head and shoulders pattern. 
In other words market is still too quiet with zero volatility. 
Lets be patient.
!!comment!!: Haven't bought since late 2020. Time to buy some more.

The dev mentioned PGP key. Someone else suggested Last Pass (did he use last pass to store his PGP key). Are Password Managers known to be easy to exploit or something?
!!comment!!: We better have 14 months of green after these 14 months of red bullshit. I'm ready!
!!comment!!: Just jumped on a plane to visit some friends for the weekend in Scotland. I realised I haven‚Äôt seen them for 18 months, if crypto ever allows me to be financially independent and not work I could see them way more often.

!!comment!!: After being 95% down, taking profits on a 5% pump.. Discuss the strategy please.
!!comment!!: I extracted the insights relevant to BTC so that you don‚Äôt have to scan through the report:

Bitcoin Findings from Messari Crypto Theses 2023:

The Mt Gox bankruptcy proceeds, which amount to a total of 137,000 BTC, may be distributed in early 2023.

Bitcoin‚Äôs parity with gold would yield a 25x return, so there‚Äôs a lot to like in adding a 4% position in digital gold for every ounce of gold you buy. At today‚Äôs prices, Bitcoin-Gold parity would bring us a $500,000 Bitcoin.

Current Bitcoin Lightning Capacity is about $90 million. Wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum (WBTC), which is just 10% of the TVL in DeFi applications, is 40x larger.

Bitcoin mining produces a lot of e-waste annually, about the same amount as a country the size of the Netherlands. Only about 17% of this e-waste is recycled today.

Bitcoin miners have been using wastes and stranded energy sources like flared methane, stranded geothermal energy, coal refuse, and even recycled waste tires. Hence, the narrative that Bitcoin mining is damaging to the environment may need to be relooked.

The wasted energy from flaring in the U.S. alone is equal to 78% of the energy used by the global Bitcoin network in 2021. Repurposing flared energy towards Bitcoin mining would drastically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.

Bitcoin mining can help strengthen renewable energy grids as renewable energy is unpredictable and results in excess energy during off-peak times that results in energy producers curtailing that energy. Miners can be a constant energy buyer of last resort, increasing profitability for renewable energy operations.

LMAO
!!comment!!: Well 2023 begins with a trap or not.but it's nice too see green.
!!comment!!: I don't understand how people's brains work. When Solana was at 9.9$ no one was buying. And suddently it gains 40% in 2 days, back to 14$, everyone wants to buy. Until they are surprised it doesn't go up anymore. they lose money or hold bags. rinse repeat.

It's actually scary and funny how the brain gets conditionned by the colours red and green.

!!comment!!: Good morning, fellow crypto regards! Seems like we are going to have a nice price action today
!!comment!!: Time to FOMO my life savings into this pump and take out a loan too
!!comment!!: To get something you never had, you need to do something you‚Äôve never done.

People really are degens
!!comment!!: Soon we will hit 6m subs! And we're in a bearmarket.
!!comment!!: This subreddit never talks about low caps, but everybody wants to buy them **after** rallying X20 in a week. You're doing it wrong, you have to buy them **before** the pump.

!!comment!!: Ah yes, 5% up after 90% down. Time to FOMO
!!comment!!: We are so used to crabbing that a small pump like this gets us hyped up.
!!comment!!: Bonk shitcoin also got added now on my exchange. If its a
Shitcoin they are fast
!!comment!!: I love a meme coin just as much as the next person but I think when the tides turn it will wipe out the memes.  Greed never goes away but I think people will be smarter with their money this time around.   I had way too much meme coin exposure in 2020/2021.  It‚Äôs all I knew.  After doing okay through no skill of my own and getting out with a tidy profit, I actually started researching what the hell I was buying and why I was buying it.  I consider myself one of those that jumped in for the hype ,hoping for a quick buck, but decided to stick around. FOMO for random coins is slim to none anymore.  I‚Äôm sure there are others in the same boat which may help determine which coins make it.  I would be very suspicious of meme pumps going forward.  2023 could become year of the bagholders.

!!comment!!: Alt season for ants? I‚Äôll take it.
!!comment!!: I opened a long on Solana just to collect funding fees at -1%
!!comment!!: I just gave my first Snek to the daily... why do we do that?

!!comment!!: I will wait 2usd in cro:) for that 2usd cro dude
!!comment!!: One day closer to the bull!!!!
!!comment!!: Ugh, might need to take a break from the daily. It's too shilly in here lol

!!comment!!: In other news: Savage and Samsung have partnered and which platform did they choose? Polygon of course
!!comment!!: It's tempting to short SOL and SRM right now, but I know it'll just get another leg up as long as that BONK hype is still there üòÇ

!!comment!!: Just purchased a nice espresso machine from Bonk gains. Now officially out of Bonk but hope it runs nicely for everyone
!!comment!!: ADA 75% off sale
Ends soon
!!comment!!: I can finally comment. This is my first.
!!comment!!: This daily is so fresh and so clean

!!comment!!: That is a sexy 1 week chart. 

Now we just need to do it again next week.

And the next.

And the next.

And then the next 30 after that...
!!comment!!: Wild how many people spam comments about Bonk and Sol (both Ponzi schemes), but almost completely ignore credible cryptos that have done well this bear market like Litecoin. 

Yeah, I know, ‚Äúdegens going to degen.‚Äù This excuse doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore. This isn‚Äôt a bull market. Those same ‚Äúdegens‚Äù that are flocking to Bonk and SOL could‚Äôve made the same if not more if they had invested in LTC over the past 6 months. 

It‚Äôs making me think a lot of comments regarding these Ponzi schemes are disingenuous and possibly deceptive.
!!comment!!: It was been 20 days since Bitcoin closed a day outside of 16k-17k. That's committed crabbing.
!!comment!!: Watching paint dry is more exciting that bitcoin's price action the last 5 weeks. Record breaking low volatility
!!comment!!: Imagine putting your BTC into Gemini earn for 1% or whatever it was per year and getting rugged.  Unbelievable.  I'm glad I knew lending crypto was üö©üö©üö©, still feel bad for these guys, getting rugged for 1%.
!!comment!!: JUST IN: üá∫üá∏ US DOJ to seize Sam Bankman-Fried's $575 million Robinhood $HOOD shares, prosecutors say.

!!comment!!: I am now getting $2 of ETH per week from staking. 

It's not much but it's mine.
!!comment!!: New DCA strategy. Putting $1 into BTC & ETH every time I see a comment talking about BONK
!!comment!!: Proud of myself I'm not even tempted to chase this next big thing that will stay nameless
!!comment!!: Feel like BTC has been in between $16.6k - $16.9k for such a long time
!!comment!!: It's nice to be reassured that crypto has a heartbeat after all. It'll be a bumpy 2023 but the worst is behind us, fingers crossed.
!!comment!!: BONK up 158% ‚Ä¶ lol people never learn.
!!comment!!: Lots of volatility last 2 days
!!comment!!: Do you feel a little fomo guys? (i.e. increasing the DCA amount per week/month?) just curious :)
!!comment!!: Does anyone else accidentally click on the ‚ÄúMonthly Optimist Discussion‚Äù and start reading the comments wondering why everyone is being so positive and then realize you‚Äôre not in the daily? Because I do
!!comment!!: What do you think it will happen first?  
\- Aliens contact Earth

2023 lol.
!!comment!!: The money I found for boink is now in cosmos. Like always I had to take the scenic route.
!!comment!!: Just another day in cryptoland. Hope everybody is having a good start to the new year.
!!comment!!: I'm not buying BONK, but at the same time I'm not shorting it. Those telling to short BONK at the top are saying something easier said than done. There are already a few times where the price made ATH then dumped the next 30-45 minutes only to make new ATH.

If someone placed a short when it dumped after setting ATH, you'd have been liquidated 3-4 times this past two days now üò¨
!!comment!!: Snek for the daily! Keeping up my snek streak for 2023 üëç
!!comment!!: Welcome to the Bonk daily! Discussion on other coins is discouraged, but permitted.

!!comment!!: I just got here today but it seems the bonking has really intensified.
!!comment!!: Goddamned... the one time I decide not to Fomo into some Shitcoin it totally takes off..
!!comment!!: Feel like I should Chuck  $20 at bonk but also knowing rationally if I‚Äôm hearing about it now it‚Äôs too late
!!comment!!: I donated a snek to the daily. We must honor the crypto gods
!!comment!!: MEXC now has futures trading up to 20x for BONK‚Ä¶this is dangerous information!
!!comment!!: One day goes by, one day closer to getting out of this sucky phase.
!!comment!!: I like crypto and believe in it‚Ä¶.

Can I‚Äôm not be a critic anymore?!

Is that how this works?

!!comment!!: What‚Äôs better than crypto? COIN up 12%

!!comment!!: Is this the correct daily? I'm confused
!!comment!!: Are we finally seeing an upward trend in the market that‚Äôs going to stick around?
!!comment!!: Like my grandfather told me once to encourage me: *"Keep pushing through, don't give up! You've got this."*

Dad: I bought dogshit coins instead

Son: üò≠
!!comment!!: [deleted]

!!comment!!: I know we are very much in the depths of a bear market and we have a while to go before we get out but I feel calm, it's letting me DCA and accumulate and not feel FOMO that the price is going to sky rocket. While not ideal I am fully prepared for another 9-12 months of this

!!comment!!: As we approach 6 million members in r/cc what tips do you have to give to the ones already here? It seems the ideology of HODL might not work out for some as we have found taking some profits could be wise. Is DCA still the name of the game too? What‚Äôs your viewpoint?
!!comment!!: Happy 14th Birthday Bitcoin üëë
!!comment!!: What comes first?

- Ada's L2 making the network usable when compared with any other working L1 smart contract (it only outperforms, and not always, to Eth mainnet)

!!comment!!: After the past year, I can't tell you what a relief it is to be green YTD

!!comment!!: so cramer was wrong this time also with both ltc and sol
!!comment!!: SOL on a mad one ü§£ü§£ü§£ no one expected this

1. Rainbow chart

4. FTX‚Äôs Sam Bankman-Fried: Solana Has a Real Shot at Becoming the Next Bitcoin (2021) - never happened

Conclusion - trust no one!

!!comment!!: Seeing green color is out of this world
!!comment!!: Finally took my tezos and did something with it, strange that they call staking, baking who knows..But atleast I did what I planned. Anyone else ever use airgap wallet,I like the fact the vault app can be stored offline.
!!comment!!: Be careful guys. 
Some random Adidas nft scam getting posted a lot right now. 

Good night everyoneü§çüò¥
!!comment!!: Anyone have spare gas to send? I will tip moons in return ! Thank you
!!comment!!: Just 1-2years ago I had a daily massage from friends asking me what coin to buy.

Lets see where the big boys are going to place their bets.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Idk if it‚Äôs just me but it feels like the masses have stopped giving attention to crypto which I‚Äôm my estimate is ripe for a radical pump. But again, who am I other than just another bro.
!!comment!!: I really hate doing taxes in the USA and having to add my crypto purchases...

![gif](giphy|l2JhtKtDWYNKdRpoA)
!!comment!!: I was just informed today is Bitcoin's birthday. I will celebrate by buying some. Anyone buying anything today?
!!comment!!: People looking to buy as it's the new year and 2022 is over, I'd still wait a few weeks. The downtrend and turmoil will continue Q1 2023 I think. I'd wait for the Fed rates on Feb 01 to see the sentiment ; there's also the BOJ situation with the Japanese bond market which no one is talking about, which could (will) shake things up. Interesting coming 3 months.
!!comment!!: Yea sell this little pump from this day . As usual üá∫üá∏
