!!comment!!: According to my crystal ball of RSI math: Target 33k, then crash to 25-28k for weekly and daily RSI reset then pump to 41k to claim it.
this will play in the next 18-60 days.

ETH RSI maths: 2300 then crash to 1800-1900, for daily/weekly RSI reset then push to 3200 target 18-60 days to play this.

After 41k or new target 51k BTC, ETH 3200 or new target 3700, major crash for reset. -30% to -37% then slowly will go back up to ATH before halving event.
Source of prediction: according to my crystal ball RSI-maths.

!!comment!!: When ETH was at 1k I was deep in the red, and I mean divorce red. I told myself that if ETH ever climbed back to 2k, I would sell to cut my losses at a tolerable level and move on with my life.

So, did I sell? Nope

Have I learned anything? Also nope
!!comment!!: How many Bitcoin miners does it take to change a light bulb?

!!comment!!: Holding coins you bought at their top just hits different
!!comment!!: What a day! finally can afford egg on my ramen
!!comment!!: Crypto world actually depresses me a lot sometimes. Seeing how people constantly get their accounts drained so simply just by connecting their wallet somewhere, and then checking those scammers wallets seeing how they earned hundreds of thousands from doing that with no repercussions is just sickening.

There is lack of justice in crypto world, and a lot of time the worst kind of people with no morals get on top here.
!!comment!!: New governance polls are up!

Don't forget to vote.

!!comment!!: So with Twitter venturing into cc trading now, will that bring in fresh $$$ and spark more buying again? Or is this just preaching to the choir?

Twitter is pretty much junk now (and still searching for rock bottom) so idk how much sway this will really have beyond a few dog-coin pumps
!!comment!!: And here we go with ETH to $2K today…… let’s have some of that throwback good feelings of 2021.  Long ETH!
!!comment!!: I remember when ETH was 3 digits
!!comment!!: Finally, ETH/BTC ratio begun going up again (reached 0.66).

I was 100% into BTC, converted 25% of it to ETH when the ratio was 0.71. I'm still slightly salty about it, but when ETH really starts going up it becomes unstoppable for a long time, I'm cautiously optimistic.
!!comment!!: JUST IN: Twitter to enable #crypto and stock trading in partnership with eToro.

2 - Strong signal that we touched the floor from a long bear market and now this could be the base start of a bullish market on the way
!!comment!!: Some desperate bear out there is thinking about shorting 31k. After getting liquidated @21k, @27k and 29k. 

While everyone is riding these beautiful green candles.

BTC is ruthless, when it goes, it goes.

!!comment!!: ETHtraordinary

![gif](giphy|eruVMzXlb70oo)
!!comment!!: There’s about 3 things I learned from being into the cryptocurrency. Those 3 things are:

1. Don’t tell anyone you’re in crypto when coins are up

!!comment!!: Someone in my DMs told me if I transfer him 0.5 ETH he will transfer me back 2 ETH! Wow such a kind person!
!!comment!!: Imagine thinking the ETH staking unlock would result in a sell off. You’re talking about people who willingly shoved their stacks into the abyss, with no return date, and you thought we would sell now, at the start of the bull run?
!!comment!!: I predict we will skyrocket up to 69k on 04/20

☮️❤️😎🚀

!!comment!!: Everyone is talking about votes… wer do I vote and on what 🤔
Can someone blz provide some guidance. Thx !
!!comment!!: Out of curiosity, how many people here have 3-6 months of emergency savings outside of crypto?
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|xxVMim5UWleHC)

!!comment!!: Can't believe I am so close to break even. 2% down only.

BTC and ETH lifting my Portfolio, while still more than 60% down in a few alts.
!!comment!!: Looks like I have an NFT in my reddit vault. How can I know it's value?
!!comment!!: DCA all last year. Bought at 15k and hated it. Sometimes you do things right
!!comment!!: ETH woke up and chose violence! 🚀
!!comment!!: As an ADA Wholecoiner this feels great
!!comment!!: That steady climb on ETH makes me feel good.
!!comment!!: ETH just hit 2.1k loving this green feels like Christmas 🤩

!!comment!!: I feel like BTC is gonna go from 30k to the next milestone in a blink of an eye. 

I've been slowing down my DCA since last October due to personal reasons, but slowly getting the groove back now. The best time to stack more sat is today. 

Also, happy to see everyone getting their moons! Haven't got a clue how some people could rack up close to 9k worth of Karma in here. Damn. That's impressive.

!!comment!!: Just watched btc hit $30k. 
- *It was a good day*
!!comment!!: For anyone who still doubted $15K was the bear market bottom, I think those doubts are starting to fade.

Bitcoin went from $15K to $30K, while having a war in Ukraine, inflation, Fed rate hikes, worldwide recessions, banks crumbling, fear of war between China and Taiwan, the SEC going after Binance, etc...

If Bitcoin can double under those conditions, imagine if those things start to cool off.

!!comment!!: We touched 30k for a brief second there.
!!comment!!: order books look like 2021 right now...i missed this.

I really hope we dont budge just keep sailing around 30k,I see everyone started getting avatars, very strange shit,Atleast I got a few just too buy them.I see them as like a modern day baseball card.

!!comment!!: Gone full Degen

Totally bought an avatar just for the right hand Snek asset.

I call my mashup "The Great Australian Sneks"
!!comment!!: Man, arent these nfts a bit of overkill? there's way too much of em. I only bought what I like but I don't really see this as investment unlike gen 1 and gen 2
!!comment!!: All I want is a modest 1000x
!!comment!!: This heart on my head is HUGE and its for all you daily peeps ☺️
!!comment!!: Eth pumping. Is it due to Shanghai upgrade?
!!comment!!: **Sha**nghai - Upgrading execution layer of ETH

Ca**pella** - Upgrading consensus layer of ETH

Shapella - the community created portmanteu to cover both
!!comment!!: Jesus, I hope they haven't taken the snapshot yet as my hair is a mess!
!!comment!!: 80k less ETH in circulation since the merge
!!comment!!: Avatar sale need to be restructured.
!!comment!!: Quite the debacle with Gen 3 avatars today
!!comment!!: Uh, today is my 3rd Cake Day !
!!comment!!: Buys a $12 Avatar and doesn't know how to act.. 😝
!!comment!!: What does the sub say about ALGO? It was this sub's favourite last year
!!comment!!: Do y’all think these collectible avatars will be worth money someday… I’m guessing most will be worthless except a few that a worth a lot because the artist became famous or they are super rare or low serial number
!!comment!!: Just spent $99 on a JPG. What the fuck is wrong with me??
!!comment!!:  "prominent cryptocurrency investor Mike Novogratz, shared his thoughts on Bitcoin's surge above $30,000 in a recent CNBC interview, noting that it has not been driven by institutional investors"

Yeah me and my homies just put in the spare quarter trillion we have lying around in the middle of a cost of living crisis makes sense
!!comment!!: To all of the shorts out there I want to say this to you as nice as I possibly can. Get rekted bears
!!comment!!: Bought an avatar! As a musician, I couldn‘t resist the one with the keytar
!!comment!!: "Wipe the CPI gains out. All of them."
!!comment!!: I like how people dump right after the snapshot. Just remember that you'll still be penalized for the next distribution if you don't buy the Moons back.
!!comment!!: Oh fak. Just got approved for VA disability after all these years. $1,650 a month(to include inflation adjustments) tax free for the rest of my life. What should I buy? Btc, eth, or material possessions.

!!comment!!: Snapshot today. Bring your best suit and a big smile
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Phew, I went avatar shopping today!
!!comment!!: I swear I’m not a bot, I am a real alive human
!!comment!!: It’s been a helluva day for avatar buyers, that’s for sure
!!comment!!: So we're basically just waiting for the CPI data tomorrow to make a move?
!!comment!!: Snapshot reminder: don't forget to smile
!!comment!!: BTC sucking liquidity from alts.
!!comment!!: The daily: “My Reddit NFT didn’t 100x immediately, what a waste. 🤬”
!!comment!!: Can't believe [THIS](https://np.reddit.com/u/me) is the person who botched the Reddit Gen 3 Launch
!!comment!!: I’m so ready to unload another half of my algo. The deeper I go the more I’m just not liking it.

The tech is great. But the design of the “expert governor” platform makes me think there’s not much thought happening at the foundation.

We’re just voting to give algo to more ecosystem projects? Really, that’s it? A year of hype, just for more pointless voting?

I would have been happier if they upgraded vanilla governance, than this overly complicated system.

What are they even trying to accomplish?
!!comment!!: Alts nearly dumped the whole pump from yesterday…
!!comment!!: I bought 500 coins to test if I could pay Reddit with my credit card.

Now what do I do with these coins and how can I reward someone with them?
!!comment!!: Look at my new customised avatar!
!!comment!!: Think I bought the wrong NFTs, all of them are still available in the shop yikes
!!comment!!: I'm still a bit salty from the NFT sale yesterday, almost got none from my list, but atleast I was able to get one Nyan cat!

Hopefuly everybody got the ones they like!
!!comment!!: I feel like this is popping off and now China is gonna go to war and fuck it all up again.
!!comment!!: I don't think a good CPI will change the fact that Chelsea FC are going to get raped later
!!comment!!: What happened to the guy who used to spam sneks award on everyone in the daily? I hope he's safe and well wherever he is. Best wishes.
!!comment!!: Shanghai, Capella upgrade in..

#11 hours 11 minutes ⏰
!!comment!!: CPI Lower than expected. Pump it !
!!comment!!: Snapshot is in 4 hours! Wohoo!!
!!comment!!: Reddit is killing its nfts with their greed, these print run is crazy, 500 pieces for $50? amd there's like 50 of them. 5000 for $10 one as well where theres more than 20 of 10 dollars one? what kind of cash grab is this?
!!comment!!: Moon

Snapshot: 00D 02H 54M 09S
!!comment!!: BTC being a lil tease today 😏
!!comment!!: What did you guys do to 30k while I was gone
!!comment!!: So is this Shangai thing out yet
!!comment!!: As someone who has been accumulating BTC as much as possible for a year now, especially below 20K BTC, I have to say I'm starting to feel like there isn't much upside in the short term anymore for BTC when I'm buying at 30k so I will stop for now. I even took some profits at 30K with the belief I can buy back at a lower price (I set an order at 25K to buyback). I believe BTC will rise in the long term but I have a feeling we are close to a local top. I can definitely be wrong but this uncomfortable feeling is enough for me to sit out for now. Good luck to all the DCA'ers, I hope I'm wrong and BTC pumps to a million in the coming 2 months!
!!comment!!: Whoot! I'm gonna breach 500 moons! This means I'll be in the 500-100,000 moons category instead of the 0-499 category.
!!comment!!: Omg the app is fixed… yay!!!
!!comment!!: We should be able to buy avatars in future with Moons!
!!comment!!: Anyone get any of the new NFTs? I picked up like 6 lol
!!comment!!: I think I throw a party for my todays Cake Day 🥳🥳🥳🥳
!!comment!!: Get your suits ready, get a haircut, shave, because it's snapshot day
!!comment!!: Who will bless the new DD with the first Snek?
!!comment!!: If anyone is looking to provide LP for MOON/ETH, and wondering how much it rewards then I can tell you that:

It gives around 1 moon per day with $280 worth of MOON/ETH in LP
!!comment!!: Today is snapshot day! What are you hopes and dreams? On my side I hope for a ratio over 0.7 and at least 500 moons
!!comment!!: Coolest Avatar for under $10 ??? What should I grab? 😁
!!comment!!: Looking forward for the day we will be able to buy avatars with moons!
!!comment!!: It would actually be super convenient to be able to buy Avatars, using our Moons..  🙌
!!comment!!: Next Avatar Gen4 we want to buy them with our MOONs
!!comment!!: Moon snapshot day, last chance to farm up that extra karma!
!!comment!!: Oof, Reddit, google play, and my bank all disagree about how many charges there should be... We'll see how that turns out 😅
!!comment!!: Bitcoin looking it has solid $30k support for right now. 💪🏻
!!comment!!: Just submitted my taxes for this past year. Next year gonna be interesting, because at this rate, I may pay some big capital gains on BTC!
!!comment!!: The NFT artists would be pretty stoked with all the overmints. Extra sales revenue for them!
!!comment!!: Muuuum, ive bought a virtual image for my reddit profile picture for only 200$ !!
!!comment!!: Altcoins dying leading up to fomc announcement, can it just be liquidating longs before the announcement? Forecast is positive
!!comment!!: Sorry dudes I just checked the charts, I bought some ETH about seven hours ago. My bad.
!!comment!!: Think it’s time to deploy some cash
!!comment!!: Snapshot day today. Hope it’s a juicy ratio
!!comment!!: Weak hands be selling here. This is the scared of CPI and news crowd. Tomorrow is the big day.

***pouts***
!!comment!!: Last chance to last chance
!!comment!!: Anyone knows why alts ran off a cliff?
!!comment!!: We below 30k, again? Guys... I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.
!!comment!!: Congrats on 30k. Moving in the right direction.
!!comment!!: GEN 3 gone, welcome Snapshot. There's always something exciting to look forward to in this space.
!!comment!!: Alts running off a cliff in anticipation of CPI data is one of the predictable things in crypto.
!!comment!!: Sold my $ARB airdrop when it started to dump. Paid off my new fridge and two months DCA into BTC so not bad for a freebie.
!!comment!!: Happy snapshot day everyone. I'm hoping to hit double figures this time round.
!!comment!!: Does the snapshot provide you with the ratio and therefore amount of moons we will receive?
!!comment!!: What is this in queu to be minted bs its has been 8 hours since i bought is this thing coming from the depths of the ocean or something
!!comment!!: Good morning, everybody. Snapshot day. Hoping for a good distribution.
!!comment!!: Today is snapshot and eth upgrade day. Hope you all enjoy today.
!!comment!!: I think will dump during cpi
!!comment!!: I‘m the real GEN 3 !

!!comment!!: Feels weird seeing it above $40,000 (Canadian)
!!comment!!: So I finally did it guys! I dipped my toes and made my first post in the sub; I was reading online and was interested in this one article and what it was saying, so I came to the sub and checked that it hadn’t already been posted and then posted it to see what people had to say and start the first step of starting a discussion! It’s not a super popular post so far but that’s ok with me as it gives me enough time to check each reply and have some conversations!

I’d like to make more posts in the future if I find something that’s relevant and interesting or useful. I’ve held off on posting since I’ve joined for that reason but I’m working on engaging more! I just wanted to share my excitement so far :D
!!comment!!: Gen 3 Avatar, Snapshot and shanghai upgrade is on the way. Get ready guys.

!!comment!!: End of the long easter weekend… tomorrows fiat mines beckon. Hope you’re all keeping okay!
!!comment!!: Sorry guys I got distracted by work the last couple hours, it won’t happen again I promise. What I miss?
!!comment!!: Daddy bitcoin always eats first
!!comment!!: Look guys. Just say a word and I will sell and you can go through 30k in no time

!!comment!!: Just submitted my third proper post here an hour ago and it was the second in a series. I'm not normally one for being part of online communities but feels good to be an active part of this one.

I was a lurker for a long time, before this profile and moons existed. Feels nice to contribute.
!!comment!!: Just purchased 5K moons on Sushiswap... was a very straightforward process!

!!comment!!: I expect to become rich instantly with crypto.
!!comment!!:  2018 ledger was new to people. I leaned this from last time though. When Legders start to get sold out, and new 'experts' start preaching about keys and asking how to use them. That is the time I will sell, not store.

!!comment!!: All of this crabbing won't matter in the super bullrun of 2024/2025
!!comment!!: Opinion could be wrong... see late 2015 early 2016 weekly Btc chart, specifically the 20wma. Slow boring with steady movement. Then see the current weekly chart.
!!comment!!: Dog logo disappeared for a couple hours...

Now its back...

!!comment!!: When I joined this sub two years ago BTC was over $58k. I thought everyone here was a genius,  giving solid advice which gave me profits the best day.

A lot of changed since then, BTC dropped over half in value and I'm a bit of a genius myself now.

!!comment!!: That’s a nice juicy Eth pump
!!comment!!: had to completely wipe my phone.    
after 42hrs i'm finally up and running again, ready to shitpost.

the easiest part was recovering access to hot wallets and exchanges, thanks to backups.    
the worst part was reclaiming access to some banking applications using mobile as token. no way to backup.    
i find this absolutely ironic. and it's a confirmation that crypto really means owning assets.
!!comment!!: ETH showing some positive movement, would love to break 2k barrier this month
!!comment!!: Why is ETH performing better than BTC? Or maybe not any reason at all.
!!comment!!: You're missing out if you don't read the Daily before checking the charts.
!!comment!!: Just checked my portfolio and wow👀
!!comment!!: If im doing the math correctly if moons had dogecoin marketcap it would be more than 100$ each.

Lessons learned and all that.

!!comment!!: I love looking at the terminal and seeing all these legitimate projects, then seeing [Bonerium and Lung Chain](https://i.imgur.com/z2psEha.png) right beside them.

Apparently these are some strange SHIBnanigans, which "aims to improve the $BONE ecosystem", whatever that is.

!!comment!!: "Canadian crypto exchanges WonderFi (WNDR), Coinsquare and CoinSmart have revealed plans to merge, creating what would be one of the world's largest crypto trading platforms".

!!comment!!: Im so dumb. I was thinking why isn't anyone responded to my comments anymore? Then I realized I turned off reddit notifications when cleaning up my phone. Back on. 😂
!!comment!!: Crypto journalism is the biggest shitcoin if you think about it
!!comment!!: Any good movies related to crypto you would recommend?
!!comment!!: Who else is in it just for the money and not for the tech? Just me? Oh well
!!comment!!: Do You still remember when You entered crypto the first time and spent days and days on comparing projects and their possibilities?

You got hyped by every update of a certain project and scrolled through countless subs. Your heart beated faster and You had dreams about the future.

Then You realized bid daddy is the only reasonable choice and all other things is based on hype
!!comment!!: All I want is a Porsche and never having to work again a day in my life.

Is that really too much to ask?

Let's hope today the charts will bless us with green candles!!!  
Have a wonderful day everyone!!
!!comment!!: Coinbase, just let things be as they are! I need Pro back!

The Coinbase Advanced Trading user interface is terrible! It's far too busy. The depth chart, which is generally an excellent short-term indicator, is totally worthless. Then, for no apparent reason, every page in the interface 404s.

!!comment!!: I didn’t even realize I got my Algo governance rewards. 112 this period 😎
!!comment!!: Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I’m a bit skeptical with the low volume on this pump.  Don’t get me wrong…love to see it, I just doubt it can hold. 🫣
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|MZocLC5dJprPTcrm65)
!!comment!!: I was told $1million btc in 80 days. Is it still happening? Need to pay rent

!!comment!!: Moon snapshot in 7.5 days...
!!comment!!: Whats happened to poor old internet computer? 

It was actually meant to have some good software wasn't it?
!!comment!!: If the next halving creates a bull run like expected, it feels too easy. Buy now and make profits next year everyone's expecting? 

It feels like it's just too easy and expected that's why it won't happen the way we anticipate it.

I feel like in 2018 the atmosphere was probably that crypto is legitimately dead whereas in 2022 it was just "next bull". 

Anyone else?

!!comment!!: what the difference between staking and providing liquidity for MOONS/ETH (in terms of rewards)?
!!comment!!: Find someone who loves you like BTC loves going back to 28k.
!!comment!!: People keep wondering about the price dipping after Microstrategy buys most times. But I think its a chicken and egg issue. Perhaps MS buying is a part of what pushed the market up, or keeps it level due to their buy pressure spread over several days weeks. And then when they let up, gravity brings things down without that buy pressure to support or extend the rallies.
!!comment!!: To keep up with Balaji's prediction, the on-day average for Bitcoin has to be around $225k by end of today.
!!comment!!: Since i sold some ETH today this is probably the lowest we will see in a long time, if not forever 😅
!!comment!!: CB trading platform is irksome recently.  Put in an order for .003 BTC....order executes for .0029990006 btc when I have fund to cover the fee over and above what I ordered.

!!comment!!: Crypto has made me so spoiled getting paid to do anything I'd do anyway like presearch, brave, moons etc, to the point that if you don't pay me to shit in your toilet I'd rather shit myself.
!!comment!!: I’ve gotten 3 scam messages in 2 days, this is a new personal record! Do I get a prize?

Y'all probably saw this, it's probably fine but revoking for good practice

!!comment!!: SushiSwap has just been hacked 


https://www.theblock.co/post/225473/sushiswap-hack
!!comment!!: BTC doing a great job as a stablecoin
!!comment!!: It’s pretty cool to see Reddits Gen3 release being talked about at the top of the coingecko newsletter for April 8th!
!!comment!!: The value of MOONS has been plumetting ever since the news of the hack on Sushiswap. 

I went to check my LP and stake in Sushi and I couldn't find it in the "My positions" tab, but when I went directly to the LP, I could still see my stake. 

As of the writing moment: The LP contains $308.5k worth of MOONS and $325.8k worth of ETH.
!!comment!!: Ouch, just saw on the Ledger sub a guy downloaded a “Ledger” app from the Microsoft store, entered his seed phrase in it, and lost all his Eth. Please be vigilant and DYOR! Only enter your seed phrase into your physical ledger!!
!!comment!!: Who do you hate most in crypto?
!!comment!!: Moons down 15% past 24 hours.
  
Still up 91% past six months.
!!comment!!: Anyone else had a lot of scammers in their DM’s lately?
!!comment!!: Dw guys, this boring crabbing is coming to an end, because:

- CPI and fed minutes on Wednesday

- PPI inflation data on Thursday

- Consumer sentiment and retail sales data on Friday

Reckon we go back down to 26k? Or turbo pump to 30?

I bet a pump to 31k and back down to crab @28k again xD
!!comment!!: Just a few more days till the Shanghai update, Gen 3 drop(s), and Snapshot day 👀
!!comment!!: Just did my daily DCA. Hope everyone’s doing good this fine Saturday/Sunday
!!comment!!: Just ordered my first Ledger off the official website.

I've just been holding my funds on various exchanges lately but it's to the point now where I'd feel a lot more secure with a cold storage.

Pretty excited to try it out.
!!comment!!: Hey now MOONs, don't do that
!!comment!!: Happy easter boys and girls, enjoy family!
!!comment!!: If you’re reading this have a great day 👑
!!comment!!: Where do I vote for the governance?
!!comment!!: Wow even the CoinGecko newsletter is talking about Reddit NFTs: *The third generation of Reddit NFTs will be dropping on 10th April, and will consist of artwork from both existing artists from previous Generations as well as new artists.*
!!comment!!: Looks like I didn't miss much. Just crabbing along
!!comment!!: Happy Easter!! Hopefully the bunny brings us $30k
!!comment!!: Reminder: Shanghai hard fork and CPI on Wednesday.
!!comment!!: How do you all make moons ? I'm new here
!!comment!!: Where would you stick $100 today ready for the next bull run?
!!comment!!: Which coin would you add to your basket this Easter?
!!comment!!: Hello daily!

It’s almost 11 pm Sunday night and it’s time for bed!

Market is crabbing. Gen 3 Reddit avatars are about to drop in a day or so. 

The avatar mashup contest is also ending too - on the day gen 3 is scheduled to drop on April 10. Up to 2,000 moons up for grabs. 

Also on that same day we are doing a Trivia 4 Moons event with a total of 1,000 moons up for grabs too. 

Make sure you join in to the trivia!

Good night everyone!
!!comment!!: Another day, another hack
!!comment!!: I read that someone in the community lost 40k moons due to the Sushiswap exploit. Man that is rough
!!comment!!: Why are Moons free falling ?
!!comment!!: Only up from here 🚀 everything looks bullish 🐮 at this point
!!comment!!: and the moon dump continues
!!comment!!: Do comments under removed posts get included in moons? I’ve had a comment with 100 likes and 900 likes under a post that got removed 2 days after posting
!!comment!!: I've often thought about signing up to sushiswap, but I'm so lazy when it comes to crypto. It's a great way to protect yourself.

Buy, stake, and hodl. Everything else can wait until tomorrow.
!!comment!!: pretty quiet day in crypto. Gonna DCA and chill... stick to the plan!
!!comment!!: Looks like I bought the top for eth today :(
!!comment!!: Buying some moons right now might be a good idea
!!comment!!: Don't worry about the moon dip. That's what Alts do. They dip and rally again.
!!comment!!: Anyone staking their matic ? Where are y’all doing it
!!comment!!: Loving all this green today
!!comment!!: was expecting more 'he is risen' jokes
!!comment!!: I like the green, keep going !
!!comment!!: With all the recent hacks and exploits I see on this subreddit I am glad to keep it simple and just buy Bitcoin without any of the other noise.

Seems too risky and requires you to constantly keep up to date with the news to avoid having your investments stolen.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: How often do you think people lie around here? Sometimes I feel people just write "Did my DCA today" because they know that's what others want to hear & that it might earn them some moons.
!!comment!!: with the rise of cbdc, its wise to dca some xmr no?
!!comment!!: Good morning! 

Don't think I've been this early in the daily before 👀
!!comment!!: Who one of you monkeys is dumping moons?!
!!comment!!: Hello new daily!

Lets go for more green!
!!comment!!: Hope everyone is enjoying the long weekend. We have a while to accumulate.
!!comment!!: Asking for some help: Does someone know a wallet or something where you can stake your DOT i want to get it of the exchanges but dont know where to stake it

!!comment!!: When is Coinbase renting the banner??
!!comment!!: It's officially Easter on the east coast. Happy Easter!
!!comment!!: Love the banner but I would not trust that 12% APR, Especially with what happened with Celsius and Gemini
!!comment!!: What’s yours guess for the karma:moon ratio?
!!comment!!: I can’t buy high and sell low if BTC keeps crabbing.
!!comment!!: Good morning I think I might have enjoyed my last peaceful rest before gen 3 lands. Tomorrow is the 10th….. wen?
!!comment!!: Good Morning Europeans, ( and everybody else who already woke up ) 

Happy Easter! It’s my first time hiding eggs, anyone got advice?
!!comment!!: Goodnight everyone, happy trading
!!comment!!: The Shapella upgrade is just 4 days away and there are only 120 validators currently waiting to exit the active validator set.

This is a huge price dump after Shapella FUD buster.
!!comment!!: Shitposting from Bowery while I wait for subway 🚊 

Anything crazy happen while I was gone?
!!comment!!: We've been crabbing for almost a month now, pretty impressive
!!comment!!: C’mon market makers. We’re tired of crabs.
!!comment!!: Does anyone know the karma to moon ratio? Thanks in advance
!!comment!!: If anyone has been using sushiswap there’s some kind of vulnerability/hack.

There’s a post about it. I don’t use sushiswap, so it’s a bit over my head but I don’t want anyone losing any coins…so please read the post.
!!comment!!: A whale opened a 53x long ($13M) on Btc and 34x long on Eth ($1.2M), his ETH long has most probably already liquidated, BTC is still above that price.    

What if he now cancels his BTC long? Can the price shoot back up?

I think it was on purpose, he is probably buying lot of cheaper ETH while the price is still down. May we now see $2000 ETH?
!!comment!!: Sushiswap hacked.

!!comment!!: How’s yall portfolio doing?
!!comment!!: oof we slowly sliding, I'm kinda over it. I think it will be healthy to not check the charts until I see Bitcoin over 30k in the news.
!!comment!!: Another day, another dex hacked
!!comment!!: The only thing I love more than BTC is my family
!!comment!!: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong's financial secretary says the country will focus on proper regulation and promotion of Web3. Bullish

It’s nice to have this downtime to relax at least.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Excited for gen 3 WOOO no sleep soon :)
!!comment!!: Can someone explain what happened to Sushiswap like I'm a toddler.
!!comment!!: Are you feeling invigorated due to the upcoming Gen3 Avatars launch?
!!comment!!: Goodnight all from Australia ❤️💚❤️💚. Feel bad for you who are hunting the top tiers of gen 3 haha, goodluck! No sleep nights incoming. What are your predictions on BTC price when i wake up?
!!comment!!: Who was affected by the SushiSwap hack? Share what happened
!!comment!!: There was a comment with URL to revoke access in MetaMask. Anybody has it ?
!!comment!!: Kind of insane how Sushiswap just gets hacked, it's fully their fault, and they do not have any legal obligation to return users their stolen funds even though fault lies completely on them. They just tell people: hey revoke all permissions from us and good luck. Something has to change.
!!comment!!: I hate to say it but Im withdrawing my mooms from sushiswap. I was part of the LUNA fiasco and I got ptsd from those days. I know its not their fault but still :/
!!comment!!: People where shaming others for using CEX, and that they should use DEX instead. And to sum up, that’s why it’s still safer to user Kraken/Coinbase, etc
!!comment!!: Maybe I’m in the minority but I found Sushi to be sketchy since the dev mass dumped back a couple years ago.
!!comment!!: How do I setup the shop so I know I can pay when gen 3 drops, all the avatars are sold out now and I dont have apple pay
!!comment!!: Looking to buy something with my XMR, anyone familiar with CRYPTO BITMART?

!!comment!!: Guys I did the best thing I could.

I ordered my Ledger Nano S plus
!!comment!!: What are you buying today? DCA Btc for me.
!!comment!!: What sound do you make in your head when watching huge green candles form on the chart?

I make the sound that happens when you get flower power on Super Mario
!!comment!!: Something remarkable - in my opinion - is going on in our LP on Sushi. In spite of today's hack and Moons price dump, the TVL of the ETH/MOONS liquidity pool is pretty much unchanged compared to yesterday.
!!comment!!: Some of these cryptos go down more often than my ex.

But not on me
!!comment!!: I want a brief explanation why these gen 3 avatars have so much value / potential and the hype behind them. A short video or article will be fine

And how am I supposed to buy them ? Where and how (currency) ? (I never bought an avatar on Reddit so excuse my ignorance)

!!comment!!: Thinking about going homeless so I wouldn't pay rent anymore and invest it in BTC instead. I'll take this as an adventure!
!!comment!!: Here are a few questions that I have regarding Moon.

1 Is it possible that Reddit may one day decide not to reward Moon or completely terminate the project?

2 Who has the final say on the distribution of Moon - the subreddit or Reddit?

3 If Reddit plays a significant role in the token distribution, is it possible that they may one day decide to merge all tokens into one?

5 & 6 Who created r/cc, and what role do they have in Moon?
!!comment!!: Yoloing 3k into some random shit coin but questioning if I should spend  €3 on a coffee lol
!!comment!!: 30 minutes to go until the long weekend of eating egg, hunting rabbits, watching charts, avoiding relatives and drinking a beer or 27. Happy easter to you all!

!!comment!!: I have eth ready to claim on main net from arbitrum nova bridge but I forgot I need 0.00521 eth for gas... I have eth on my layer 2 network but obviously that wont help me.

Is there anyone willing to help me out? Would be more than happy to send some moons as compensation.
!!comment!!: You guys got some of that hopium for me?
!!comment!!: I’m starting to think we won’t see $1M
!!comment!!: Anyone else remember how cocky Do Kwon was? Guy acted like he was a God amongst men with his cringe posts. Glad he's locked up. Karma's a bitch.
!!comment!!: NOOB question. If I use a software wallet, transfer my crypto and then store the 12 words somewhere on paper, does deleting the software wallet app effectively make it a cold wallet (since it now only exists on paper)? I ask because suggestions are that having a hot wallet app on your device is not that secure since it's connected to the interwebs.

Thanks
!!comment!!: Holy smokes. Seen some leaks!  New stutter is fire!! Rojom is fire too!
!!comment!!: Happy Good Friday! As the Lord is Risen, so is BTC!
!!comment!!: I see ADA in the banner, I like
!!comment!!: OK guys so I have a gaming buddy that lives in Germany, my neighbouring country. We've known each other for 15 years and game pretty much daily. We've seen each other several time IRL and I trust him.

He has no idea I'm into crypto and I have no intention of telling him. HOWEVER, he just told me his cat, who is about 5 years old, needs surgery. He can't afford it. He's seriously considering just putting it to sleep because he has no choice, but I know it would break his heart (and mine to be honest, I hate seeing animals suffer)

5% of my portfolio is ADA. The rest is BTC and ETH. I'm seriously considering selling my ADA... that would be enough to cover for the surgery. I would never ask this money back because I know he doesn't really earn a lot. This would be purely a gift.

Don't know what to do. I know it will sting if ADA reaches another ATH especially since I bought it back in the days when it was sub 0.10€ but on the other hand, I wouldn't forgive myself if he put his cat down because I was too greedy.

Wouldn't tell him where I got the money from though. My crypto stuff is strictly confidential. It's really just "here, I pay for your cat, no questions asked"
!!comment!!: I surpassed 200 earned Ada on my Yoroi wallet with todays epoch 😎💪🏻
!!comment!!: I wish you all a freaking nice day from the bottom of my hearth

!!comment!!: Just when I made a little profit. AC unit broke.

!!comment!!: Max pain scenario is BTC to get stuck @ $28k for the next 6 months + Alts keep bleeding.
!!comment!!: Im so excited my local public toilets is about to adopt safemoons orbital shield to identify heavy dumpers
!!comment!!: How am I seeing some people with the “I voted” badge but I can’t find any recent governance polls? Am I missing something?
!!comment!!: Counting the days until retirement. Hopefully BTC can half this counting in the future!
!!comment!!: My portfolio is worth more than previous bull run. Steady but slowly DCA every pay check. Hope it's going to work out. 😁
!!comment!!: Where do you stake your DOT?
!!comment!!: How/where to keep your seed phrase safest?   

Tattoo your keys on your genital and remain a virgin forever, simple 🤷🏻‍♂️
!!comment!!: Okay 30k quit fucking with us, it’s time.
!!comment!!: Good morning internet magic friends!
!!comment!!: Is the ledger really simple to use? I am not tech savvy is it easy to screw up and lose it all?
!!comment!!: I thought I'd never have kids but now I have 6 crypto tokens I care for dearly
!!comment!!: Wait…is the Moon Snapshot, Gen 3 drop, and Shanghai update all on the same week? Hot damn…
!!comment!!: I read a comment about how cool it would be if eventually you could retire from shitposting because of moons. I’d love to walk into the office and tell my coworkers off and quit.
!!comment!!: you already answered your own question. 

btw, a good life guiding rule is:  Never regret the things you do… only the things you had the chance to do an chose not to.
!!comment!!: Just curious who thinks we will see a 20k bitcoin again this year?

!!comment!!: Some rumor/gossip for y'all:

Earlier today, an address sent 68,400 moons to the burn address in this transaction:

https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/tx/0xad3cedb117c19db26f72516108ee9398fc4e4a7f7d70b389e13a0f5928c1cd5b

This typically means someone has rented the banner, or intends to host a sponsored AMA. Due to the large burn in this particular case, it's more likely they've booked the banner for a long period of time.

So who is our next banner renter? Well, there may be some clues.

The [0x155] address that burned the moons had purchased them on SushiSwap with roughly 10 ETH. The ETH used here came from another [0xE5A] address, mostly in this transaction:

https://nova.arbiscan.io/tx/0x6ab108b08d0237569183f9f586ce78e578c562644c7956016860404aac2c90ee

And that [0xE5A] address was first funded with 11.1 ETH from another [0x31E] address in this transaction:

https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ef6e4c2939ec24a8f1dc3cff42e82a7ee7c93be1501b11fcac5470c93ccbfde

Now this [0x31E] address is very special, in that it has sent/received almost **$380 million** from Nexo:

https://i.imgur.com/QeDjZm6.jpg

Could it be that our next sponsored banner is Nexo Exchange? At the very least, we can say this person/entity is a very large customer of theirs.

!!comment!!: Btc really loves to just hover right at 28K lol
!!comment!!: I’ve realized the hardest thing to do is be patient with dry powder to lump sum. I have plenty of exposure already so I’m waiting for a price closer to 17-20k. I guess I’m trying to time the bottom but maybe not the absolute bottom. And if I miss it that’s ok. Of course because this is my strategy the bottom is already 100% in.
!!comment!!: two major ways to look at this price level. interdasting confluence as always  


crabbing sideways bouncing ontop of the 236 of the retracement from the high on the btcusd chart; and if you divide it by gold then we are sitting at the 2017 peak, kinda looks like some miners have been stacking bars recently  


make no mistake, we do not want commodities to go up. that is not good, bearish for the economy  


as gold goes up, the s2fx value goes up. the december low looks like it was the cost of production and chain maintenance floor.
!!comment!!: Why is it that every time Saylor buys BTC, the crypto market dips?
!!comment!!: I hope we’re not heading to a weekend dump…
!!comment!!: Man I am tired, couldn't even look the charts yet
!!comment!!: This might be the dumbest move I've made this year, but Im rotating some BTC into alts here. 

Looking at the BTC.D breakdown, I can't help but think that BTC will crab here for some time, while alts still have a lot of room to pump.
!!comment!!: Of course I can be completely wrong, but I feel continued success for Bitcoin is inevitable. It’s been deemed valuable by humans for what 14 years now? Bitcoin continues to grow & a healthy rate & is accepted by governments. Even the SEC with the regulatory mess going on has already said it is not a security. I don’t see why or how it can not continue to grow in use & value

Tips are anonymous, so while I responded to a few comments with my appreciation, definitely missed some people and wanted to thank everyone who chipped in. Maybe they'll see or be referred to this comment later. I never expect or need donations to keep the website running, but it certainly lightened my mood today when I saw them
!!comment!!: remember when cramer said to sell your bitcoin last week?
!!comment!!: After many months of deep red, my btc finally almost even lol

Bought on the way up back in April 21, got rekt ofc, been steady DCA since then and brought avg price down to 29.6k. Was very slow at work for a few months and I couldn’t accumulate nearly as much as I would have liked during the 14-18k days.  

So close! Kinda bittersweet with the pumping, was enjoying these lower prices but good to also see some solid recovery. 

Anyways - gl out there

!!comment!!: Does anybody you know in real life invest in crypto? I don't know many people who invest in crypto since it's too risky, so I like hanging out here
!!comment!!: Some people just choose to ignore the pump BTC has seen in recent weeks and start whining in the first dip. Such attitude will never serve you well in life imo.
!!comment!!: This months pay had 3/4th of my salary deducted as taxes (cuz payroll fucked up and did not deduct correctly earlier)

!!comment!!: Gotta love seeing xlm stay strong during a red day
!!comment!!: A good way to lose friends is to recommend crypto to them
!!comment!!: I decided I wanted to go down the rabbit hole on how to buy and sell moons so that when the day comes when I do ever want to sell I will be ready and know what to expect.

The whole process needs to be more simple.

I consider myself to be pretty technically inclined and even I struggled.

You have to know how to import your seed phrase into your wallet, import a custom token, Learn the ins and outs of a DEX, learn about layers and coin swapping, all sorts of different fees and 8 days waiting time to bridge from arbitrum nova back to main net.

If you ever want to sell or buy moons I highly suggest taking your time, do your research and send a small test amount at first.

I was dumb and sent some ethereum from arbitrum network to the main net wallet and lost it.

!!comment!!: I just saw the BTC logo projected onto the ECB. That's absolutely fucking GENIUS. Do you know what it reminds me of? Do you remember that guy holding a BUY BTC sign behind Yellen? That happened in July 2017 and put Bitcoin in the spotlight, and triggered a buy frenzy that sent it to a new ATH.

[Look at it](https://i.imgur.com/ihnLZIw.png). It really triggered the biggest crypto rally ever.

Can it happen again?

!!comment!!: I've been hearing a lot of rumors about XRP, such as : 

- A settlement with the SEC


- XRP being adopted for some countries for cross borders transfers ( especially after the big de-dollarization movements by the asian countries).

Could those rumors be the possible reason why XRP has been performing amazingly?
!!comment!!: Looks like we may end off the week with a bang or earlier at this rate.
!!comment!!: Boom!  It’s a thing of beauty.
!!comment!!: Can you believe that only a few months ago, the market was panicking from FTX, bracing for sub $10K prices.

People thought crypto was royally fucked from the FTX collapse, and contagion would clobber the rest of the market for at least the next year, maybe more.

And here we are trying to knock on the door of $30K.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: BTC going higher and higher in these times is such a big statement.

Winning the case means a big win for the whole crypto space.
!!comment!!: Dang. My buy orders didn't execute from the dip

!!comment!!: Crazy day, I guess there's always a surprise around the corner to look forward to in Crypto.
!!comment!!: binance fud army out in full blown, apparently china banned crypto again
!!comment!!: Just a little more and i can panic sell
!!comment!!: Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

Win up to 1,000 moons. 

Good night 💤🌙😴 and see you all tomorrow!
!!comment!!: Just baked some cookies on my day off work. They smell great.
!!comment!!: Can someone explain to me how you actually make money with liquidity pools? Yes, you get a cut of the fees. But how does it compare to HODLing an asset? Unless it only moves sideways, I can't see how it is particularly profitable even with 300-400% APR if the price moves significantly in a few months window. I know that seems kinda strange to say. But, unless its a small/new coin, why would you not just HODL or stake (one sided)?

With impermanent loss and slippage, does this not ruin all your gains?
!!comment!!: Yes government tried everything to manipulate the crypto market/prices by using “ regulation “ “ protecting the customer “ card . 
But the truth is that crypto’s positive sentiment is quite high and been high for almost 2 month now , so i honestly believe they can’t suppress the market any longer … one more good news the market will rebound real quick .
!!comment!!: Just closed all of my leveraged positions with ~5-10% lose on binance and bought btc/eth for everything, send to ledger

Don’t underestimate the stress those *sexy* alts give you

!!comment!!: **The all ENS .ETH name domains are zero-fee registration today posts are a scam**

I came home from work to see this headline and without thinking followed the link and accepted the contract connect like a scrub and had my eth drained. Fortunately it was just my spare gas wallet so no big loss.

Do not follow the links, these guys are spamming all the crypto subreddits.

!!comment!!: Looks like tonight is the fight to the death with 27k.
!!comment!!: Well guys. What a freaking day past few days. 

Microstrategy disclosed buying Bitcoin which always tanks prices. Then Binance is alleged to bypassing US regulations as well as insider trading.

Not to mention the bug that brought down Binance over the weekend. Was it even a bug or were they trying to scrub data from Binance before allegations were released,
!!comment!!: Does anyone know why the apy for ETH2 differs so widely between Coinbase (3.8%) and Coinbase Wallet (4.51%)? Given that it’s the same company, I’d expect a similar APY.
!!comment!!: Feel like nobody was using binance.us anyway. Is anyone here actually thinking any of this is a big deal for binance? Lol
!!comment!!: Im glad moon is still strong !
!!comment!!: Oh BTC crashed and it’s dead for good again? Bought some today, and some MATIC.
!!comment!!: Surprised Matic is down...a sell on the upgrade rumor?  I'll buy more at one oh four!
!!comment!!: Oh no, more Binance FUD, sell everything!
!!comment!!: Can't believe all those sneks yesterday lied to me!
!!comment!!: alright guys I will sacrifice and sell my 0.000003 bitcoin to pump it back to 28K

I just hope ya'll have a wonderful day and make sure to keep a smile on no matter what your portfolio looks like
!!comment!!: In 5 days I'll get paid and make my bi-weekly DCA. 

It'll almost certainly be enough to push BTC past 30k and I'm doing it all for you.
!!comment!!: Just saw someone on twitter say they made 0.37Eth from staking 32 ETH since November. So close to a whole ETH over the year. Is that about the right amount for staking  32ETH?

!!comment!!: This subreddit has shit for content and I spent a considerable amount of time creating an **actually** useful post for those claiming the ARB airdrop tomorrow and of course automod removed it for having a discord link... then automod removed it because the official page to check if you qualify for the airdrop is somehow is a sitewide banned link... then I remove that and repost it and it gets removed with no specific reason...

Gotta save space for the same old worthless garbage I guess.

!!comment!!: I can't believe I get so excited over an old man announcing federal monetary policy now.

It wasn't supposed to be this way, but here we are.

!!comment!!: Yo checking in almost 5 and half years after initial investment. Back then I was pretty confident I‘d be rich by now lol. Invested mainly in btc and eth but also Nano (back then xrb), req and iota. I went all the way up to 500% potential profits somewhere along the road but I just checked and I‘m back to 50%+ potential Profits lol. Not the worst. But still, in regards to my confidence in 2017 it’s sobering. I did. sell some btc during the Tesla craze but that was just some leftover change sitting on an exchange.  Other than that I haven’t sold or bought since 2017. let’s see what the next 5 years look like. Still feeling good about the long long run

!!comment!!: Fed Chairman Powell just said: "Some additional rate hikes may be needed."

>He quickly corrected himself and said "some policy firming may be needed."

The man himself isn't sure about what he's supposed to do, Fed is really doomed.
!!comment!!: 🤣🤣🤣 “bitcoin at $1 million in 90 days”

!!comment!!: ADA finally burst through the 0.38 resistance... the last time that happened back in Jan 2021, it shot up to $1 within a couple weeks. Those were different times-- still, one can hope...
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|lQh95VIYba5yba2H08|downsized)
!!comment!!: How was it in this sub in the bull run? I could imagine that there was way more spam and a pretty low moon ratio. Are you planning to stay as active as you are now if the sub gets flooded?

!!comment!!: Cracked my phone and don't remember the seed phrase (⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠)
!!comment!!: So you’re telling me the U.S. government went after just about every single major entity in crypto and even dumped 9 figs of BTC on the open market, and it’s still the best performing asset of the year? Lmao

!!comment!!: Looks like ADA is trying to go for 0.40 again.
!!comment!!: do u guys prefer investing or trading, and why?

!!comment!!: So lords and ladies of the crypto verse. What's for breakfast on the last fiat mining day this week?
!!comment!!: 10 years ago, March 31st the price of Bitcoin was just $92.19

Ask yourself, where will Bitcoin be in an additional 10 years? Really puts into perspective how vast and evolved the crypto landscape has become is such a short timespan.

It's a blip in financial history but an undeniable shake to the system of currency. Just 10 years...

!!comment!!: Fiat mines, chores and exercise is done for the week. The beers have been opened and the lie-in has been locked-in......if i dont see 30k within the next 4 hours, im gonna roundhouse kick a stranger.
!!comment!!: Crypto is the only reason why I have to change my underwear every week.
!!comment!!: What do you guys think about the government selling BTC? Apparently they already sold 220M and plan to sell about 660 M later this year in 3 batches. We seemed to have absorbed the selling pressure well so I think we'll be ok.
!!comment!!: I can almost taste 29k. It tastes delicious
!!comment!!: Do you ever think that r/cc is filled with bots? I mean I'm definitely a human but not sure about the rest...
!!comment!!: Was googling what are fortnite bricks and stumbled upon one of the greatest things I've seen on here and it seems like not a well known thread considering it got just few points. It's basically a fortnite shitposting kid that got a lot of bricks (they're like moons of fortnite sub)  and he found out they're worth something so asked people here how to sell them and what they're worth, and when one of the users told him his bag is worth almost $5k only thing he could say was: BRUH

https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ovlp6h/i_have_153162_bricks_on_the_fortnite_subreddit/h7a3kwf/

 Like imagine being that kid, he's probably like 14-15, he shitposts on Fortnite sub, ignores that thing around his username until one day he asks what even is that, and he's like wait I made $5k unknowingly by shitposting Fortnite memes.

!!comment!!: I guess I'll just keep buying while we crab.

!!comment!!: the return of the 30c moon incoming
!!comment!!: How will we toast when moons break that 30 cent barrier again?
!!comment!!: Anyone like me. Get $100-$200 extra cash. Want to buy a video-game or splurge on stuff. Instead I throw it into crypto hoping to turn a quick profit and buy even more stuff. Instead, end up diamond handing. Then months later, same thing happens.
!!comment!!: Good morning. 

End of month and crypto still looks good. 

Lets see what april will bring us!
!!comment!!: XLM really carrying my portfolio right now and i am quite tempted to sell as it tends to follow XRP which dumped this week after it’s brutal run up… crabbing is way more relaxing than this

I've been limiting myself to a glance once a day and the results speak for themselves.

!!comment!!: Bull Market is back everyone
!!comment!!: I think at this point we can confirm that the XRP won the lawsuit

!!comment!!: We show resilience, we smell bullish as hell

!!comment!!: Alts coming back also. 
So strange that they didn't pump along with BTC last time. I understand BTC dominance, but still it was weird.
!!comment!!: Feels like yesterday I jokingly asked in here (when everyone was very bearish) what if BTC never goes below 20K ever again. Now it genuinely looks like a possibility.

Negative and Negative results in positive?

!!comment!!: 10 years ago today, Bitcoin hit $100 for the first time ever.
!!comment!!: Just sold most of my BNB stack. Traded into ETH and BTC. Kept a small amount for trades and transfers. It's just too risky with all the drama going on with binance right now. I've done well. 365% gains and avg buy price was $34 and avg sell price was $305

!!comment!!: Is it just me or is the trading volume down with most cryptos today? Is it because it's Saturday? Or is it because it's April Fools' day? 

Just checked MOONS transaction volume. Down 52% compared to yesterday, and yesterday wasn't even that impressive.
!!comment!!: What are you DCAing in this crabbing market? As long as it keeps on crabbing, it is going to be strong enough to break the $28k resistance for the next leg up.
!!comment!!: Happy Saturday and a nice Fools Day to you all !
!!comment!!: Dude my post is the top submission for this month!! That’s insane it reached over a million people the fact this subreddit give you that opportunity is so cool
!!comment!!: If you are overexposed in $ARB perhaps consider selling some. For the reason --> take a look at the front page. 


Another scenario is that maybe Arbitrum team will respond with a reasonable explanation but I really doubt it. They are really late on this...
!!comment!!: I don't get it why people are hoping for btc to go down to 20k.. Why didn't you guys bought when it was hovering around 15k for a month? When btc hits 20k, These are the same people who will say waiting for btc to hit 10k to buy at those juicy prices..

!!comment!!: I added to the MOONS/ETH LP on Sushi exactly 44 hours ago. 

My LP yields are almost non-existent. 

Staking the LP has given me rewards that are worth about 0.01 MOON per hour with an initial investment of 100 MOONS and 0.015 ETH (about 57$ worth at the time). 

My impermanent loss is at 0.44% or 0.259$.

My yields are about 0.235% or 0.13$.

This gives a real APR of around 46.8% compared to the 48.29% announced on the staking site.
!!comment!!: It looks like Safemoon wasn't safe after all.

!!comment!!: I miss krakens banner haha
!!comment!!: Ayyyyy cleared out my wallet and sold alts to BTC this afternoon.  Dumps on RJV, STX, LSD immediately after.  Love getting the timing right.
!!comment!!: We should have the right to choose if a banner can be published or not, even if is already paid. This looks awful.
!!comment!!: So with 69 artists confirmed for the new Reddit avatar is there a chance that it will drop on 4/20 ?
!!comment!!: What is your biggest regret in crypto?
!!comment!!: Good job Arbitrum team. You couldn’t wait and had to f*ck up right from the beginning. Why are these crypto devs are so greedy all the time?
!!comment!!: wow these arbitrum team are fucking shameless lol.
!!comment!!: Might load up on some ADA with this dip
!!comment!!: Lets go! Another day, another sat

!!comment!!: Yesterday I sold my ARB because it looked like the proposal was gonna pass in the early hours of the voting period. Now it looks like the majority of votes are against it.

I'm happy about that for Arbitrum & our moons. Nonetheless alone the audacity of this proposal leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I may regret this but I'm not fomoing back into ARB even if the update gets rejected. I'm converting the proceeds to BTC instead.
!!comment!!: Shanghai upgrade and moons snapshot will be on the same day!
!!comment!!: Is BTC going to break the resistance next week?
!!comment!!: Stack BTC and ETH no matter what

!!comment!!: Wtf Reddit. They are literally running ads on here promoting phishing scams on here masking as airdrops.

I am on phone app now so that is why I see them since I use adblock of course on PC
!!comment!!: Last night I sold 35% of my portfolio in case BTC loses 28k and alts bleed.

Today I bought back in after a 2% drop, and it keeps going down.

This is why I was DCAing instead of trying to time things. I'm a monkey with no self-control.
!!comment!!: Good morning daily! It’s 7.15 am here in Australia Monday morning and I’m getting ready to mine fiat!

!!comment!!: Do you think ADA will go above $3 in the next bull again?
!!comment!!: i only just realised moons are displayed now im shy too comment coz everyone knows i am noob

!!comment!!: Welp... idk if I fell for the FUD or not, but I swapped off my ARB drop... 

I've held a few projects that have shit the bed and I've seen significant hits for not selling when I had the chance (JUNO I'm looking at you).... truth be told, I don't have a whole lot I can afford to spare, but I do what I can wo jeopardizing my family and there's positions I just can't chase.... 

So I put 1/2 into MOON and the other 1/2 is slated for BTC dips 

PS any good DEX to swap ETH for BTC?
!!comment!!: What alts is everyone buying?

!!comment!!: What will change if certain cryptocurrencies are deemed a security,

Like apart from the whole financial freedom aspect what changes in terms of making money off crypto if it is deemed a security? From my understanding it will just come under the regulations of the SEC but nothing changes in terms of gaining a profit from the project? If that is the case then this fear of crypto becoming a security is just because the financial freedom aspect of it gets taken away if im correct? Please share your thoughts as i want to understand why there is such fear of SEC taking over crypto.
!!comment!!: BTC has been holding up pretty well despite being in my range resistance hmmm
!!comment!!: Man the blue chip Nfts are dropping like rocks, undecided if its the bottom to pick up a moonbird or clone x. Azuki has been holding up well.

**BUT WE ARE BORN AT THE PERFECT TIME TO HOLD** ***ETH***
!!comment!!: It’s fun to think that in the distant future, it is likely to happen often that people will find notes or plates with 24 words in old houses, just as it is now with old people with money and/or gold. 

How many wallets will be hidden for years and years

!!comment!!: Is anyone here into [Gridcoin](https://www.gridcoinstats.eu/), which you can earn crunching data for the BOINC project? It's a really fucking cool idea! Earn GRC while you use your spare CPU to run numbers for various projects.
!!comment!!: Has anyone seen these rumors flying around about Steve Jobs being Satoshi since the discovery of the white paper hidden on Apple devices? I personally don’t think it was Steve, he would’ve had to be a very very busy man to work on BTC and Apple at the same time, and big things happened in 2009 for Apple and it was also when the BTC network first went up so I just don’t think he could’ve done both at the same time but I’m interested to hear what others think :)
!!comment!!: We are less than a year away from Bitcoin halving.

!!comment!!: I have a feeling alts are gonna have a deep red Easter.
!!comment!!: Shout out to the person awarding ducks right now
!!comment!!: For new folks just getting into crypto and Reddit avatars..

Don’t forget to set up your Reddit Vault. Write down and keep your seed phrase that it generates for you safe. Don’t share it with any strangers, no matter how convincing they may seem.

Also, if you’re planning on buying avatars via the Reddit shop on drop day, make sure to have your payment methods set and ready to go. 

If you’re buying on an iPhone or Android, have your gift card balance loaded (great plan to avoid your bank issuing a “Fraud Alert” because of rapid purchases. Can be purchased online or at most gas stations or stores for Apple and Google Play Store gift cards.) And don’t forget about adding a credit/debit card or two as a backup as well.

Next week is going to be FUN! These leaks coming out are already badass. Have fun!
!!comment!!: 386 days till next bitcoin halving, keep DCAing 🙏🏼
!!comment!!: Let’s Break that barrier my fellow bitcoiners
!!comment!!: I’m thinking in the future BTC will be somewhat like the Dow. Kind of useless as an indicator but it gets all the attention because it came first.
!!comment!!: I added more moons to liquidity and staked them. But I lost the previous LP reward for doing this as rewards seem to be reset ;(
!!comment!!: Happy Easter

Happy long weekend

!!comment!!: So bullish! How long will it last though?
!!comment!!: finally I can eat some steak. It has been a year since my last steak
!!comment!!: Imagine waiting for a $12,000 bitcoin.
!!comment!!: Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be getting paid to shit post on the internet. Look at me now, mom! Moons making dreams come true.
!!comment!!: A coin like Moons that only have around a 100 million coins in Total Supply, at .34 cents is wild! It's crazy because the potential is huge with such a small amount of coins to go around for everyone.. I swear the only way from here is up.. Considering the past 12 months, while most of the Crypto was in the red, Moons were going up.. + 560% !! And this is just the beginning too.. 

We just need one big exchange to list us, and it's gonna spread like a wild fire.
!!comment!!: Good morning from Switzerland 

Where news about credit suisse are non stop. Now they're talking about a merge between CS and UBS to stop the bleeding.

Meanwhile, i'm heading to my first boxe lesson, because bitcoin created in me an urge to fight and defend myself.

Have a beautiful day.

!!comment!!: This looks exciting but remember to take a break from the charts.
We've been through the worst of it (touch wood)
!!comment!!: Thanks everyone for the great reception on the [pokemon cards](https://ccmoons.com/card) I made for avatars!

Since people seemed to enjoy them, I'll probably create at least one more iteration of them (but it'll be a few months from now at least). Curious to hear your thoughts on any changes I should make.

My first ideas:

1. Fewer "Normal" types. Even though it's one of the most common types in the game, I don't think anyone thinks they're interesting. I'll add other types (Ice, Dark, etc.)
2. More rarity tiers, with a slightly more even distribution
3. Enter two usernames and simulate a battle. This will be very simplistic, likely just outputted text sentences about the result and no animations.
!!comment!!: Happy Saturday from Vietnam guys, enjoy the gains!
!!comment!!: 30k within days , the psychological barrier ( 25k) been broken many times , the trend is upwards, positive sentiment will triggered fomo within the crypto-space and outside lurkers

!!comment!!: ![gif](emote|moon_emote|moon)Got a friend of mine convinced him to buy Reddits moons a few years back.  He spend a couple of grand bought 15k of them back at 12 cents.  I nudged him the other day…”hey man you still have those moons?”  His response?  “I’ve never even looked at the price.  I’m a forever HODLER.”  He’s who I want to be like in life.  Nevermind his hot wife.  ![gif](emote|emo_pack_1|dancing_wojak)

!!comment!!: This Balaji guy who's betting 1 million on BTC hitting 1 million in three months probably has other, much bigger bets on Bitcoin hitting 30k or 40k in three months. He's just hoping to create enough hype, possibly even Elon commenting on Bitcoin again, to make his actual money bets come true.

!!comment!!: A colleague of mine got lucky last bull market and he bought himself a Mustang with his profits.

Now every fucking day he complains about the gas mileage.

Hard to feel sorry
!!comment!!: I was told April was supposed to be a bullish month but it looks like crab party

!!comment!!: I was so close to be getting paid for my sperm. Unfortunately the second I mentioned crypto during the interview, I got disqualified… at least I can still donate blood
!!comment!!: After about a week I'm now up to half a loopring from staking 🤣

Gimme a couple more months and I'll be able to buy a beer 🍻
!!comment!!: Amazing how much your chart addiction disappears when the price doesn't move.
!!comment!!: You know, given where we were last year, 28k is beautiful.
!!comment!!: My post got removed for karma restriction so I was told to post here.

Accepting crypto at my small business - what have you used as customers and as a business?
ADVICE
I am the owner of a small business and I am interested in accepting crypto payments from my customers. My business is a drive-thru coffee shop so I need payments to be fast and can't have someone holding up the line for 5+ minutes trying to make their crypto payment. I am trying to figure out what options have been used by other businesses and customers.
As a business owner, what crypto payment options have you used to accept payments? Which ones have you found to be the most user-friendly, fast and secure? As a customer, have you ever used crypto to make purchases? Which payment options have you found to be the most convenient, fast, and reliable?
Any advice, tips, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you in advance for your help!
!!comment!!: Well got a 12 HR overtime shift today but it's more money for ETH
!!comment!!: Wait so how do you get these so called moons?!
!!comment!!: We’re gonna get rich or get broke trying. Who’s with me??
!!comment!!: My golden rule of investing in crypto is to never celebrate or become arrogant about unrealized gains.  
  
What is yours?
!!comment!!: Happy easter weekend everybody may your basket be green
!!comment!!: It’s already Sunday here. Happy Easter Everyone!
!!comment!!: Locked out of my vault 🙄 goodbye adorable free nfts and moons I guess
!!comment!!: Last bull run I went from a potential brand new tesla plaid to used 1998 Honda civic. Greed amirite.
!!comment!!: I have a new boat obsession and damn, they're expensive. So can we get a bull run already? Please?
!!comment!!: BTC is gold and ETH is silver
!!comment!!: Watching the sub completely flip the script on NFTs because of these Reddit avatars is kinda crazy. This sub has insane doublethink capabilities. 

Another example is how any other coin with the structure of Moons would be hailed as a shitcoin. Penalizing use case? Voting to artificially raise the price by limiting sales?
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: How is nexo offering 12 percent after everything we’ve been through
!!comment!!: Rome wasn't built overnight, the same applies to Crypto. Keep on accumulating through these times and reap the most when the time comes.
!!comment!!: Added another 0.0178 BTC to my portfolio. Feels good.
!!comment!!: Let's spread that positivity the few of you here. Snapshot day looming, let's all get a ton of Moons!
!!comment!!: Binance US def has low to zero (ETH and BTC) trading fees, but those withdrawal fees are criminal. 

The other day I bought some BTC with zero trading fees on binance but it cost me $5.88 in fees to withdraw.

I also bought some BTC on Coinbase for $0.40 in trading fees and a $0.75 withdrawal fee.

Also, the ACH deposits on Coinbase seem to be instant now and I was able to withdraw right away with no hold on my funds. Pretty nice feature for those that want to withdraw to a cold wallet and not hold any funds on an exchange.
!!comment!!: Please use the sideways market to accumulate more. 

I've been in the space since 2017 and made large profits. 

Still, the only regret I have is not buying more during bear markets.
!!comment!!: Family is asking how to get into crypto again. Sell signal
!!comment!!: I hope ya'll have a wonderful day today. Good morning ya'll
!!comment!!: Where can a US citizen buy Monero?
!!comment!!: Wonder where we will be in 5 years
!!comment!!: Took some profits, bought really expensive shoes, start regretting it, because I could've kept it in btc instead. One can just never win.
!!comment!!: 5 days until ETH withdrawals enabled! 😊

Going to be  interesting.
!!comment!!: Sean Dyche is definitely a BTC bull
!!comment!!: Has anyone ever mocked/dismissed you for being invested in cryptocurrency?
!!comment!!: Gen 1 floor prices rising 👀 I’m Lovin’ It
!!comment!!: What makes you happy in crypto?
!!comment!!: ccMoons site says, I have burned zero moons. How do you burn moons?  
I know you can spend moons to buy special membership, is that called burn?
!!comment!!: I’ll be honest! I’ve had hopes for LINK but man the lack of price action on the coin makes it sad to hold at times
!!comment!!: Id love to see some action, go btc eth
!!comment!!: Coinbase CEO says the exchange will integrate the Bitcoin    Lightning Network🙌
!!comment!!: My portfolio is struggling but there's always money in the banana stand
!!comment!!: daily back to around 3k comments.. crazy how much the price of moons affects the activity
!!comment!!: Has anyone been buying at these crab level prices? I’ve been doing my usual Eth and MATIC buys
!!comment!!: Oh, back to 28k. How unexpected.
!!comment!!: Good morning daily fam!

Be a part of it!
!!comment!!: Just a reminder to support your fellow farmers. Fight the bots and be generous in the comments. The only way we can succeed in this battlefield.
!!comment!!: My application to the ethglobal hackathon got accepted lfg!
!!comment!!: This price action is so boring
!!comment!!: Ohai 28k nice to see you again
!!comment!!: My swing trading strategy:

Only trade coins your comfortable holding for the long term. Buy on 5% dips and sell on 5% gains. Have a separate holding portfolio so you’re still exposed to 5%+ gains. Don’t risk more than 10% of your trading portfolio on one trade. 

This has worked well for me so far. Sometimes I go multiple weeks without executing a trade. I only trade when there’s a clear opportunity. 

Thoughts?
!!comment!!: We have SLIGHT LIFTOFF. Half a percent is a lot these days.
!!comment!!: I was just saying to a Redditor in the thread but I want to say it so everyone can see it, I am so thankful for finding this sub a few months ago, I’m coming up on being here for 4 months and I haven’t ever found such a great collective of minds who share similar interests with blockchain technology and I enjoy the chats I’ve had with all of you and how we can check all the boxes so to speak when it comes to feeding my thirst for learning on how to transact and navigate in and through the blockchain! I wouldn’t have gathered half the information and new things I’ve learned just in these four months in even a years time if I was alone without being able to turn to this sub for help! Thank you for anyone who’s helped me that sees this and I hope everyone has a wonderful Easter I love all my CC sub fam :D <3
!!comment!!: I’m supposed to DCA this weekend, but I’m travelling this week, so I think I’m just gonna wait until I get home. Not gonna try to time the market, but hoping I luck into some discounts 😂
!!comment!!: Hey guys. Just wanted to ask, are your friends, family members or work colleagues started talking about crypto recently?
!!comment!!: so wait...is it 'dough'gecoin or 'dodge'coin...because i've probably been pronouncing it wrong the whole time.
!!comment!!: Anyone else feel like this is the calm before the storm? Just don't know which way the wind is going to blow.
!!comment!!: Football tokens pumping. CHZ might worth taking a look at.
!!comment!!: Ngl, it's weird seeing a Nexo banner in a crypto sub like this where people advocate self custody 😂
!!comment!!: Almost 1/3rd of the day over and just 1k comments..
!!comment!!: It's really touching to see how fierce of a support level $28k has been.
!!comment!!: So as long as you have your wallet id and seed phrase your crypto is safe? Or is there more to it?
Ps this is a simple question about holding crypto not about prices or projects crashing. Thanks in advance for answering my dumb question
!!comment!!: I know it’s gonna sound like a stupid question, but what happens to our debt/mortgage if a CBDC rolls out? 

The reason I ask is when I sign any loan or mortgage agreement, I agreed to repay X amount of USD. If USD tanks in value due to the CBDC rollout, would we not theoretically be able to purchase USD with the new shitcoin CBDC (that our bank balances have now then been converted to) at a severe discount and pay off the debt for a fraction of the “price”?
!!comment!!: Whatever happened to that GME NFT store?
!!comment!!: Hello from Switzerland, 

Where the fiat minning doesn't stop! But it's easier to work when you have a plan!

Keep it strong out there.
!!comment!!: Hey community,
what are you buying today?
!!comment!!: Wishing everyone happy easter holidays :)
!!comment!!: Does anyone do any crypto side hustles (other than posting here for moons) or staking that actually net you a decent bit? If so, what do you do and how much does it bring in? I'd love to be more involved in the crypto space but not sure what's really worth my time.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Crab or not, Eth still deflating.
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: Twitter has gone back to its old logo, Doge will continue being a stablecoin from now on.
!!comment!!: I love the fact that the original creator of nyancat will now have his own avatar in gen 3.

That might be the one I would like to buy out of nostalgia
!!comment!!: News flash! Gen3 coming sooner than you think
!!comment!!: $1  still gets you over 3500 sats :)
!!comment!!: Shill me a low/mid cap that you think will go apeshit next bullrun
!!comment!!: I wouldn't be sad if this sub decided to ban or limit gaming-related posts.
!!comment!!: According to coingecko, 67% of users feel bad about Moons today. Please do your part & change that [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon) (below the chart). Thank you :)
!!comment!!: Happy Easter for everyone! Enjoy the time with your loved ones or take some time to take care of yourself :)
!!comment!!: How we doin' fam? We on track to reach 1 million within 90 days?
!!comment!!: I talked to a girl the other day who was telling me all the altcoins she was buying during last bull run, and I said was looking forward to the next halving and she had no clue what I was talking about.  

How does that even happen lol?
!!comment!!: Are we even sure the market is turned on? Swear everytime I check the price it’s the same…wakey wakey!

!!comment!!: Is anyone else as obsessed about the fed CPI report this Wednesday as I am? BTC should move quite a bit based on the report. I’m anxious! Haha
!!comment!!: Happy eastern guys, enjoy the days
!!comment!!: I have been back to this sub for a week now and have not seen anyone mention lambos , or use rocket moonboi emojies and people are being actual real people on here! So this os what a bear feels like...
!!comment!!: I hate to be that guy, but I am curious.  What’s the next big upgrade after Shanghai gets completed?
!!comment!!: people always ask “wen moon” but never “how moon.”
!!comment!!: if you told me a few months ago that moons were just chilling at 25c I would not have believed it.
!!comment!!: Congratulations, your presence in this sub will be rewarded with a swift retirement in 10 years. Be blessed!
!!comment!!: Gonna buy in the next 15 mins. HBAR or ADA? 🤔

Edit: HBAR it is
!!comment!!: only ten people here 👋 smol team
!!comment!!: What's everyone doing this long weekend?
!!comment!!: Happy Easter everyone! 

Just woke up, grabbed a black coffee and now time to run to the store to get some eggs 🙂
!!comment!!: If you’re reading this have a great day 💚
!!comment!!: These last couple days have been so slow and boring, I almost feel like doing some house chores

!!comment!!: My wife in the bear market: How is *Your* crypto portfolio doing?

My wife in the bull market: How is *Our* crypto portfolio doing?
!!comment!!: I'm not even American and US government still finds a way to fuck me
!!comment!!: Did you know that the first altcoin, Namecoin, was created in 2011? It was created as a fork of Bitcoin and was designed to be a decentralized domain name system. Namecoin is still in use today and has a market cap of around $20 million.
!!comment!!: Crypto giveth, and crypto taketh away... Unless you're holding my Alts. Then it's mostly just taketh 😂
!!comment!!: If I buy now, the prices will dump. 

If I wait to buy, the prices will pump.
!!comment!!: BREAKING:

> Binance and its CEO CZ were sued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for allegedly breaking trading and derivatives rules - via Bloomberg's
!!comment!!: BTC to 1 million is inevitable
!!comment!!: That Bitcoin monthly chart lookin sexy and scary at the same time. What you think lol
!!comment!!: Holding ADA is probably the most boring thing
!!comment!!: 3% more and i’m even on my portfolio and into over all profits land. So close now. 
Been in it since Nov 2021, held all through 2022 + DCA.  Gone too far to stop now!
!!comment!!: Remind me to never post anything in r/ledgerwallet again.  I've had days of nonstop DMs from "support team" members offering to help me out of the pure kindness of their hearts.
!!comment!!: Key Events This Week:

1. Consumer Confidence data on Tuesday


2. Home sales data on Wednesday


3. Q4 2022 GDP data on Thursday


4. Treasury Sec. Yellen speaks on Thursday


5. PCE inflation data on Friday


6. 4 Fed speakers this week
!!comment!!: Ohh lol i just learned something about hex in their sub

So one guy had it stacked until 2031 and needed the money and unstacked.. you know what happens ? Yeah all his crypto goes poof then and gets paid to others

Like how do you invest into this shit and think its a sane idea lol

Just imagine for a moment the BTC you bought just vanshes from you and others get it because you wanted to take profit 

Profit you can only do via staking for 10-20 years. If you take it out to soon.. it lets you. But then your tokens just all vanish into other peoples wallets

We have people that defend this crap on /cc

How do these people get away with this ? Safemoon v1 v2 same story.. didnt read some vague discord post somwhere and want to sell v1? Yeah 100% tax bro and of course the dev´s get them and can sell them lol

How do people see these "features" and decide to buy it lol
!!comment!!: Another day, another dip caused by US regulations

Every one of these dips were actually healthy for the overall trend. 

If we were in 2022, news like these would take BTC down -12% instantly. *Not anymore, the narrative is just too strong now, money isnt safe in banks, might aswell put it in magic internet money*
!!comment!!: Is there any case where moons shouldn’t be called a shitcoin? 

It just cheapens discussion. Why do we need governance? what does it provide? CCIPs have moved on from governing anything to just manifesting new means to prop up the price to later dump on someone else. Whales single handedly voted to limit sells as a means to artificially limit sales, which destroys use-cases in general. 

If *any* other coin did this, it would be rightfully called a shitcoin.
!!comment!!: Notable fines and lawsuits in crypto in 2023 alone include:

1. Coinbase
2. Binance
3. Silvergate
4. Nexo ($45 million fine)
5. Terraform 
6. Genesis
7. Kraken ($30 million fine)
8. 20+ celebrities

The list extends well beyond these top 8, and it's only been ~4 months.
!!comment!!: I have a strong feeling that the XRP lawsuit is ending real soon, and the SEC is losing it. That would explain why they are going after everyone
!!comment!!: Anyone disappointed with the recent binance news?
!!comment!!: It's time for another Snek giveaway! Tell me the last coin you bought and I will give you one. While supplies last!
!!comment!!: 57,307 blocks until halving.

!!comment!!: Whenever I buy BTC goes down and whenever I sell BTC goes up what to do?
!!comment!!: >Kenya signs deal with Saudi Arabia and UAE to buy oil with Kenyan shillings instead of US dollars.


Sounds like Kenya is ready for some freedom.
!!comment!!: 28k again! we can get used to this.
!!comment!!: What's the funniest reaction you very received when trying to explain MOONs to friends or relatives?

!!comment!!: Yay bullmarket! 

I shouted in excitement as my -55% portfolio recovered to a -48%.

!!comment!!: Operation drive all cexs out of US. No crypto shall taint the sacred banks
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: I bought yesterday. Sorry guys…
!!comment!!: I thought all the ‘dip always right after a DCA’ comments were moonfarming bullshit. Set up my dca orders last month and boy.. I get it now hahah
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: I believe we are at the base of a bull run
!!comment!!: Although I'm not a fan of crab I much rather it 27-28k then 19k thats for sure
!!comment!!: I’m only in my twenties but being in crypto, I feel like I’m in my fifties with no money.
!!comment!!: Happy Sunday guys! Mental health was kind of ass today, but still managed to drag myself to the gym so that’s a minor victory 💪🏻

!!comment!!: I'm predicting $40k Bitcoin within 8 weeks. Not financial advice. But I'll happen!
!!comment!!: BTC is up **14%** since Jim Cramer told people to sell it two weeks ago. Someone should pay him to say that every 2 weeks...
!!comment!!: I had a bet with my dad that if I get over %90 from my maths exam he will give me some money. I aced my maths exam :) Time to buy some moons
!!comment!!: Looks like XRP is waking up again. Strap in
!!comment!!: For anyone who wasn’t around last bull market. If history repeats itself here’s how it goes..

BTC pumps to all time highs = alts get dragged along barely on dollar value but die on BTC pair.

Along the way there will be dips that make you doubt it’s a bull market = alts get rekt 

Once BTC has a new all time high and is trading sideways or upwards very slowly = alt season 

Random alts will do insane numbers and normally starts with ETH pumping. 

Fun times to think ahead to on a Monday.
!!comment!!: MicroStrategy now has **138,995 BTCs** with an average of **$29.817**. They are almost break even, incredible
!!comment!!: Does the karma displayed on ccmoons  already take into account the various multipliers?
!!comment!!: Do you guys actually scroll through r/cc threads or just skip directly to the daily?
!!comment!!: What qualities define a good (crypto) investor in your opinion?
!!comment!!: Does anybody here plan to own 1 whole BTC, or is this next to impossible for the average person?
!!comment!!: The whole crypto ecosystem should wall itself off from the US financial system completely. Let it rot.
!!comment!!: So there you go some of you were "bored" of this price action hope you enjoy this red..
!!comment!!: My goddamn 100% alt portfolio 😤
!!comment!!: I think this is a total overreaction. I guess the bots picked up negative news about CZ / binance and started panic selling.

I don't see that this specific claim is anything existence threatening for binance. They were sued, they will either pay it or go to fight that.
!!comment!!: US government is obviously scared of crypto
!!comment!!: Guys , real soon these “ regulations “ will have little or no effect on the crypto market  . SEC are running out of bullets .
!!comment!!: These US regulators think they can touch BTC by going against centralized exchanges... meanwhile every 10 minutes a new block is created.

Tick tock, motherfucker - BTC
!!comment!!: Just read details of the lawsuit. Absolute BS and unclear charges.
!!comment!!: 101 Sneks means the dip is temporary
!!comment!!: **BREAKING NEWS**

Coinbase and Binance to join forces and buy U.S. government for $100k - plan to list the dollar as a shitcoin

!!comment!!: So binance is being sued by the Futures Comission, meanwhile BinanceUS doesn't even have futures, what am I missing here?
!!comment!!: Life's just better knowing my crypto is in cold storage
!!comment!!: Bitcoin is so undervalued at $27k .
!!comment!!: Just transferred all my funds out of Binance to a software wallet for the first time since started to invest in Crypto.
!!comment!!: Anyone else make a dot ETH name yet? I think it’s free rn
!!comment!!: Wtf are these 'muricans doing
!!comment!!: crazy to think last year I looked at the Reddit NFT shop and thinking who tf would spend 10€ on these images. Now I'm more than ready to throw 100€ on a gen3 image. This is really showing that I'm not in it for the art, I'm in in for money
!!comment!!: What the SEC has taken upon itself, in this crusade against crypto, is a straight up abuse of power.
!!comment!!: Where does a guy go to post an article on the main r/cryptocurrency?  I can't find it.
!!comment!!: It’s really harder than you think, to not look at your bags. 
I’m gonna try and not look at mine for a month. I’m still gonna look at the daily. Just once a day….
!!comment!!: The additional 6,455 bitcoin increases MicroStrategy's total holdings to 138,955 bitcoin. Average cost of $29,817 per coin. With the present bitcoin value of $27,900, the holdings are valued at approximately $3.88 billion.

He's finally averaging down. Those big buys during the last bull will take some time to offset.
!!comment!!: We’ve had max fud on the bitcoin and crypto space now for over 6 months  by the US government and its regulators, and the price is nearly 2x off the lows… dips are for buying.
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: I'm not worried about Binance, but at this point if you lose your coins because you left them in an exchange which collapses, I don't have much empathy for you.
!!comment!!: What caused this recent dip?
!!comment!!: You know how it is - you lose some, you lose some
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: Im confident by EOW we will be back to same price as this week end. It needs more than this to scare me
!!comment!!: Hi everybody. I am a new creator for the gen 3 reddit avatars coming out soon. I just wanted to let you know I am a big fan of crypto and this sub (usually lurking under another user name), so I decided to make a crypto themed dude. You can see a sneak peek on the collectibleavatars sub. hope you like it!
!!comment!!: Opera browser has this real cool feature where it detects if you copy an address, and lets you know if what you pasted is actually what you copied (anti-clipboard malware). More browsers should adopt this
!!comment!!: I have a feeling alts are about to get slaughtered in the next couple days.
!!comment!!: New daily, new sneks. 

Withdraw your crypto from exchanges.
!!comment!!: Anyone hear about NASDAQ opening crypto custody services in Q2?
!!comment!!: Who else bought today? What you grab?
!!comment!!: Had a great weekend away from the charts spending time with the family celebrating my dads 56 birthday. Coming back to a nice touch with 28k again lets break it this week and go for 30k. From now back to the charts we go
!!comment!!: Seems really sus that crypto is being targeted in a time where US banks are vulnerable.
!!comment!!: When is LINK going to move?
!!comment!!: 🤣 Literally a couple hours after I sold, my alt pumped 30%.
!!comment!!: Maintaining my snek streak for 2023 👍 back to the fiat mines on a rainy Monday…

!!comment!!: Crypto is too strong.

Its bigger than the US.
!!comment!!: What coin has brought you the biggest profits since you entered crypto?
!!comment!!: Coinbase Wells Notice, warning of potential federal securities law violations.

The SEC has gotta stop with this
!!comment!!: How many moons did you get this distribution? We’re you happy with what you got?

!!comment!!: Guys…am I crazy for still feeling bullish & sooner rather than later?
!!comment!!: Kraken changed up their banner to dark mode for the Kraken Pro ad. Very nice
!!comment!!: The secret to selling moons THEY don't want you to know: You need 4 apps/sites. Metamask (for importing your Reddit vault moons), novafaucet (for ETH on the Nova Arbitrum Network, needed for gas) Sushiswap (for exchanging Moons to USDC or ETH), and [orbiter.finance](https://orbiter.finance) (For bridging that USDC/ETH back to the Ethereum Network).
!!comment!!: Why is so many excited about ARB? Is it a good project?
!!comment!!: Whales forgot that we're crazy enough to hold and keep buying.
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|QBMjDd1ei2JyJvbzeq)

SEC's movements towards Crypto isn't a question of 'if' they are trying to tank the market. It's 'why'.  
  
From the movements, it seems that crypto is too uncontrollable and it might deter the strength of USD. I reckon that their move is to 'blanket' crypto by targeting stablecoins, and use the Digital Currencies by CBDCs as the new stable coins.  
  
This way, they can trace every transactions from in and out of crypto.
!!comment!!: Good morning. Nice rebound.

Lets go!
!!comment!!: I'm going to go against the grain and say this is gonna be a green week with healthy 3-5% increases every day
!!comment!!: First time i used crypto to buy something for like 5$ it was pretty cool!

!!comment!!: Wonder what will happen first. Btc having 3 red days in a row or my dad coming back home from the supermarket.
!!comment!!: Can anyone explain why mods received 25k Moons this round?

There were 200k moons to share among 14 mods from what I know

200 000/14 = 14 285

Shouldnt they get 14k Moons instead 25k Moons?
!!comment!!: Well.

Well.

Well.

Color me impressed. Not only is MEXC good for purchasing moons, but I just discovered that you can send eth directly to arb one address, no worrying about bridging. Not sure if that's new, but I feel like a few months back I had to send eth to mainnet and then go to arb bridge site. Maybe I was just taking extra steps.
!!comment!!: Imagine trying to explain to your dad what you have in your Reddit Vault:

- MOONS
- BRICKS 
- ETH
- Reddit Avatars NFT’s

Mine would just think I lost the plot 🤣
!!comment!!: 1. Cathie wood (Ark Invest) sold 160,887 shares of Coinbase stock this week
2. Coinbase then gets investigated by the SEC

Isnt this the most obvious case of insider trading? Jesus.
!!comment!!: SEC speedrunning their way into being hated by the entire crypto space it seems.
!!comment!!: Crazy how much the dynamic of the crypto landscape can change in just a few weeks.

Stepped away for what doesn't seem like a long time and I feel like I'm completely out of the loop.
!!comment!!: New alt account…. With crown!!!
!!comment!!: Up or down. Choose a direction
!!comment!!: What’s with all this recession talk today? Weren’t we already in one all of last year?
!!comment!!: Early bird catches the worm 🐛 
It’s been Thursday for 5 hours aaaand it’s airdrop day. 
Wishing everyone decent gains today ✌🏻
!!comment!!: I'm very happy with the new avatars!
!!comment!!: Defi question. For those of you who know, how do you claim fee rewards from providing liquidity on Sushi? for example on uniswap, there is a big "CLAIM" button with a number there. I can't find anything like that on sushiswap. Am I being stupid and missing something obvious? Also what is the "total assets" counter at the bottom, above the pool size? It is something like $10 for me, which doesn't make sense unless those are my rewards?

Please help. Thanks!
!!comment!!: Moons payday and my generosity extends to my wife who is now doing grocery shopping at a local drugstore. (Why drugstores in Japan don’t just sell medicines is beyond me though). Gave her 5000 yen (about 50 bucks) n felt on top of the world !
!!comment!!: Everybody hyped about ARB airdrop and I ain't getting any 😭 Alexa play Lonely by Akon
!!comment!!: If Ethereum was a bodybuilder, what would they drink?

Gwei protein 🥛
!!comment!!: Was folding the entire family’s laundry when I felt the tremors of an earthquake. But I was nonplussed and continued with my folding because earthquakes happen every other day in Japan 

A nice reminder that the shocks generated by the crypto industry are like minor earthquakes in Japan. Just keep doing what I’m doing
!!comment!!: Can BTC really reach 1 million USD till 2030? Is there a realistic possibility?
!!comment!!: Yes, you are too late for the ARB airdrop… please stop asking.
!!comment!!: Litecoin is doing a random pump again. It really does have a mind of its own
!!comment!!: Jobless claims more positive than expected; 191k vs 197k.
!!comment!!: ARB had a sharp wick to $11.5 in Kucoin, currently ranging from $6.9-$7.3

These bots claim fast
!!comment!!: [Refresh, Refresh, Refresh, Refresh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBTBFaAkgzQ)

!!comment!!: Cheers to those who bought the dip yesterday! 🥂
!!comment!!: Pump? BTC just listed on Coinbase?
!!comment!!: Airdrop finally claimed, not really inclined to sell or buy at that price.

!!comment!!: If this really is the start of the bull run, it’s gonna look so obvious looking back
!!comment!!: damn 28900 is a huge wall and it's exactly on the historical log line of BTC, we absolutely need to break it this time
!!comment!!: Can LTC make a miracle come back and catch up to ETH?
!!comment!!: Would you guys continue to move up the corporate chain where you get more responsibilities and higher salary or stay in sort of a sweet spot where the salary is decent enough and you have a limited set of responsibilities you can efficiently complete?
!!comment!!: What an eventful day!! Kept F5 for more than an hour for the arb airdrop, as the website kept crashing. Then I went to the contract address via arbiscan, and called directly the "claim" method to get my tokens! (risky, but it worked!). Tried many times to sell on uniswap, it kept failing no matter how I increased the slippage. Checked on kraken and I saw it was already trading, sent the arbs to Kraken via the arb network, it would also fail until I changed the fee to something outrageous like 20 (4$ transaction cost). Got them into Kraken, managed to sell them at 1.41$.

Never ever won the lottery, or a ruffle, or anything like that. And here I am, someone just gave me this money for free. Unbelievable.
!!comment!!: As someone who didn't get the ARB airdrop, this whole daily is speaking another language to me.
!!comment!!: Bobbing up and down between 27-28 isn’t too shabby. Better than being under 25.
!!comment!!: Do Kwon’s arrest makes all this red totally ok.
!!comment!!: There are about 400 absolutely unknown shitcoins with more market cap than Moons, who’s buying them? I don’t get it.
!!comment!!: And BTC is right back to where it was prior to the pre-FOMC meeting pump.  


Papa is on a mission, and FUD won't hold him back.

!!comment!!: Well, at least tomorrow is Friday. The weekend is near, hope you're all having a good week so far! Been a pretty fun one, lots of events here which is a change from the boredom a few months back
!!comment!!: I have money in a savings account, stocks, real estate, and crypto. Right now I'm only optimistic on my crypto holdings.
!!comment!!: Hands up if you sold the Arb airdrop for $8 a pop.
!!comment!!: SEC wanna stop btc but BTC is unstoppable.
!!comment!!: Just sold 1200 MATIC to save my cat’s life. Is this… the future?

EDIT: Now watch it pump boys. You’re welcome.

EDIT2: Wow lot of cat lovers! Thanks for the kind words. I wasn’t expecting it, more just thinking aloud about the situation… ten years ago “I sold crypto to cover a vet bill” would be a nonsense sentence. She disappeared for a month after working out how to pick open the doggy door. I thought she was gone forever, but a few nights ago I found her huddled up against the fence which backs onto an empty field. Unfortunately, as soon as I picked her up, I felt that she was bleeding. She’s getting stitched up today, and I hope she’ll be back to her old self soon.
!!comment!!: Hey everyone, I'm the guy running crypto for the homeless. For those of you who don't know already, we are a 501c3 (nonprofit) organization completely founded and developed on reddit. We have currently raised enough funds to last us for the next decade or so - and our claim to fame is that we spend almost all of our funds solely on food/goods for the homeless (we have zero overhead/administrative fees/salary). Everyone who works for us is doing it volunteer/pro-bono.  
  
This is not the end-all be-all solution for homelessness, but it is a great proof of concept that shows what can be done with minimal resources to make a real scaling solution to help out homeless people. We have a network of volunteers that are currently working very regularly and getting reimbursed in crypto (which allows international volunteers to receive reimbursements without any barriers).  
  
Currently, this year we are focusing on getting a couple people recruited on the team that have skills in social media. Specifically youtube/tik tok/reddit. I am looking for someone who believes in this project willing to learn and work consistently as a team member! There are some benefits that come with it as well:  
  
If you are full-time (30 hours a week minimum) you qualify for PSLF (student loan forgiveness).  
  
All members will receive their own company email address.  
  
Office 365 access as well as google workspace access.  
  
Another thing we are looking for are sponsors. I always loved the idea of collaborations no matter how small - and even if it's a link exchange I would absolutely love to work together/collaborate/link exchange with other organizations that we can get behind.  
  
Thanks again! Don't hesitate to reach out to me or respond here.

!!comment!!: Incoming recession fiat hoarding gang stand up
!!comment!!: A mistake I do over and over:

I see altcoins that break out but fade the strongest ones in the hope of catching some who haven't moved yet. 

Most often, the strong coins keep pumping, while laggards keep lagging.

And every time I fall for it.

!!comment!!: A pleasant Thursday everyone! Wishing each one of us to have full of gains today.
!!comment!!: Interesting stuff. Hence I picked Turtle!

!!comment!!: ETH looking great, Carpe Diem friends.

Seize the gwei!
!!comment!!: Can ETH go to $5k soon? I promise I'm not asking for a lot.
!!comment!!: BTC is definitely going to get a candle to test 30k at some point this week. Do we fail the 30k test and dump a little after? Maybe, but there is still lots of upward pressure at 28k.
!!comment!!: someday sooner than you think, some of yall reading this comment will buy a brand new car with your money from MOONs.

!!comment!!: Back to home after fiat mining, didn't checked charts yet but daily is so bullish, so crypto would be too.

!!comment!!: damn a lot of announcements from new Gen 3 artists
!!comment!!: I used to hold out hope that ALGO would succeed, but I have basically lost all my money by DCAing into it the past year. I only have about the same $ amount as my initial purchase at $1.6 even after DCAing so long, I guess I'll just hold it till it goes to 0. 

But I'm done DCAing, I'll find some other shitcoin to pour my money into.

On the other hand this could be a good time to buy it during max fud, but I doubt it. Probably just dies like nano etc. This myAlgo hack really  was the last straw in the eyes of most investors it feels like.

!!comment!!: Checking in to check how many moons i ve received
!!comment!!: I have been riding the high of taking profit all day, I forgot to mention this morning that I’m eternally grateful to this community.

When I was -80% down and at a big loss it was thanks to this subreddit that I started DCA’ing June last year.

I thank every single one of you and I hope to be part of this amazing community for a long time

!!comment!!: Can we stop dumping? Thanks
!!comment!!: BTC dumping to lows not seen since two days ago. Historic.

!!comment!!: It's been 24 hours since claiming the new avatar. I know it's still new thus the shiny new toy syndrome but TURTLE! pretty happy about it 🐢
!!comment!!: The arb drop was a good exercise for me in trying out bridging and cross chain swaps.  There are a lot of options nowadays.  Its also nice that CEXes accept arb one eth and switch to L1 easily if you'd like.
!!comment!!: What changes do you reckon Do Kwon did to his appearance while on the run? Moustache or maybe even a beard? Maybe plastic surgery?
!!comment!!: Currently testing trader joe’s LB with my arb drop. This shit is seriously printing
!!comment!!: daily got alot more active! good 2 see!!

*Checks prices anyway*

!!comment!!: People taking profits on LTC, while I just bought more. Think I'm outsmarting them all.
!!comment!!: Wow Deustche Bank dumping as it’s credit default swaps (price of insurance in case it goes bust) goes crazy high. BTC still ok (for now) hanging on to 28k…
!!comment!!: Still have little bags of some alts that i didn't completely sell in 2021. I have low convictions on them to perform as good as other options. Might get rid of link, dot & near to buy something else newer and shinier
!!comment!!: I sent all of the ATOM I bought today to my Keplr wallet, maybe that’s why binance crashed.
!!comment!!: All this price action will look like a straight line in 20 years.
!!comment!!: The amount of spot traders that will get stopped after Binance resumes trading will be crazy
!!comment!!: Ahh nice seeing do kwon getting arrested
!!comment!!: Imagine i just transfer my arb airdrop to sell on binance just before they suspended spot. Wow that blows.
!!comment!!: Has anyone here opened a Kraken account because of the banner they bought?
!!comment!!: "Est 60 min ish ETA. Our team's doing pre-trading tests now. For those new with us, our resume SOP is roughly as follows:

!!comment!!: Anyone remember when you had to manually swipe down in your vault to claim your Moons?
!!comment!!: Why do I feel like investing only in Bitcoin? Is it the hype? Am I getting old?
!!comment!!: How I spend the last 10 minutes:

I’m up $500, should I take profit?

Oh, it’s starting to go down, I’ll wait until it recovers.

I’m down $100 no point in selling now

!!comment!!: self-proclaimed crypto gurus are back at it again on Twitter
!!comment!!: Just spent the day at a local public library with my family. Renewed my resolution to read books on crypto. Knowledge is power. Power to the common man.
!!comment!!: What are some thoughts on DOT? I like how it’s decentralized and secure. My question is in regards to utility. It is utilized for staking to help keep the system secure, governance, and parachain auctions. Another utility is that it can be utilized to pay for transaction fees when messaging and exchanging data between blockchains. How significant do you think the utility can be in regards to the fees paid between blockchains?
!!comment!!: Plan, be patient, execute. 

Half filled swing short average 28.2k. Will keep adding any spikes above 28k. Will be biggest trade of the year in terms of size.

Or

Do you just send moons from your vault to metamask?
!!comment!!: What crypto is unpopular on here so I know which one to buy and wait for next bull run? I listened to this subs favorites 2 years ago and it was a bad decision.
!!comment!!: Managed a crying baby to a chuckling and finally a sleeping one. I feel that I can turn my crypto portfolio the right side up, if given patience and time!

and Kraken page Moons price tracking is down [https://www.kraken.com/prices/r%2fcryptocurrency-moons](https://www.kraken.com/prices/r%2fcryptocurrency-moons) 

Still chance we get Moons listing 👀
!!comment!!: Now that you can just buy moons. I Can’t tell who is a real active member of this sub Or who just bought theirs.
!!comment!!: Alts not catching up to BTC huh. Needs some rocket emojis🚀
!!comment!!: Bitcoin battling to hold 28k for the daily close… will it win the fight?
!!comment!!: ETH below 2k is definitely undervalued
!!comment!!: It's payday so you know what that means
!!comment!!: Just bought 2 ATOMS.

I hope they don't collide 😬
!!comment!!: Hey everyone, I'm the guy running crypto for the homeless. For those of you who don't know already, we are a 501c3 (nonprofit) organization completely founded and developed on reddit. We have currently raised enough funds to last us for the next decade or so - and our claim to fame is that we spend almost all of our funds solely on food/goods for the homeless (we have zero overhead/administrative fees/salary). Everyone who works for us is doing it volunteer/pro-bono.  
  
This is not the end-all be-all solution for homelessness, but it is a great proof of concept that shows what can be done with minimal resources to make a real scaling solution to help out homeless people. We have a network of volunteers that are currently working very regularly and getting reimbursed in crypto (which allows international volunteers to receive reimbursements without any barriers).  
  
Currently, this year we are focusing on getting a couple people recruited on the team that have skills in social media. Specifically youtube/tik tok/reddit. I am looking for someone who believes in this project willing to learn and work consistently as a team member! There are some benefits that come with it as well:  
  
If you are full-time (30 hours a week minimum) you qualify for PSLF (student loan forgiveness).  
  
All members will receive their own company email address.  
  
Office 365 access as well as google workspace access.  
  
Another thing we are looking for are sponsors. I always loved the idea of collaborations no matter how small - and even if it's a link exchange I would absolutely love to work together/collaborate/link exchange with other organizations that we can get behind.  
  
Thanks again! Don't hesitate to reach out to me or respond here.
!!comment!!: This sub is sorta like a hivemind Jim Cramer, I remember telling the daily I was buying Moons around 3-5 cents to load up and everyone was calling me an idiot for buying something that was 'free'
!!comment!!: Moons you live and die by no existent liquidity
!!comment!!: First snek for the daily! BTC holding at 28k, just need ETH to crack 1.8k!
!!comment!!: 2 Days to Moon Distribution and on each distribution moon gain $0.1 🔥.
!!comment!!: Seeing people with 500k+ moons is insane. That’s absolute life changing money if this goes to $1+. Being a mod in this sub has the potential to change your entire life. Insane.
!!comment!!: Years ago when BTC would run, alts would pause, then when BTC would pause, alts would run. Anyone see this happening soon? Anyone buying a alts right now for a swing trade hoping that when this BTC run pauses alts will spike?
!!comment!!: Can’t decide if I should buy more BTC or if I’m too late in this rally so I should buy ETH instead assuming that alts will get a delayed rally at some point.
!!comment!!: Steady lads, deploying more capital - The US FED.
!!comment!!: It's a bit comforting to scroll through the daily and see just how many other people are also feeling FOMO for not having enough crypto right now
!!comment!!: Stock futures looking ugly. I don't love that.
!!comment!!: Can we start a kraken listing moons post like we do with Coinbase listing VET on Thursday?
!!comment!!: This week is going to be interesting. We’ll see if crypto is able to continue this trend while banks are scrambling.
!!comment!!: so how much exactly gas fee that needed to withdraw 400 moons? thanks
!!comment!!: Waiting for kraken banner. Any idea when will it be up?

stats are based on a few things, like moons, subreddit activity, account age, etc.
!!comment!!: Gentlemen, I am proud of you for holding the 25k line
!!comment!!: I feel like someone should teach an internet safety course for those that need to learn internet understandings. Growing up in the 90s and 2000s in a household that had a computer made these sort of things very obvious but not everyone has the awareness to determine a scam from a legit source.
!!comment!!: BTC touched 27,500 …

Which is insane considering I bought some for 19,600 just a few days ago

I really feel Bitcoin is finally going to show off why it was created, that in the face of all these banking and policy failures it will fulfill the destiny Satoshi envisioned
!!comment!!: I feel like crypto has the potential to solve so many problems if people just give it a chance. I'm almost certain that crypto will either play a huge role in our civilization or it will be completely outlawed and shut down. There's no in between imo.
!!comment!!: Let's hope Jim Cramer makes a shitty comment about Bitcoin soon would be nice if includes some bearish emojis too this time
!!comment!!: oh shit, it's happening. Who knew the next bull run will be sparked by bank failures
!!comment!!: Too many people are connecting their cold wallets to extension or other contracts and getting scammed. 

Everyone should have a hot wallet for this. You send desired amount from cold wallet to hot wallet then connect to whatever your doing. 

Minimizing risk. You need to be paranoid.

!!comment!!: Pay credit card debt AND invest in crypto?

Here’s my dilemma.

I have a job that pays $85k a year. I have ~$59k in credit card debt and ~$34k in federal student loan debt. I am not too concerned about the student loans due to low interest rates (~3-4%) with a possibility of $10k of the ~$34k being forgiven if the Student Debt Relief Plan passes. I do have an ongoing 401(k) loan with 4.25% interest that I took out (~$12k) during the COVID-19 pandemic to invest—I have a remaining balance of ~$7k.

Personally, I have had decent returns on my crypto investments (>80%) over the last 2 years that puts my investments at ~85k. Of course, my goal is to be debt-free, but I also want to have some more skin in the markets this year because I see a lot of buying opportunities coming in and out throughout 2023 due, in part, to macroeconomics, particularly around interest rates and inflation. This could offer big rewards, of course at a bigger risk, in the crypto space.

Here is a breakout of my assets and liabilities (not including housing and other expenses):

- Cash: $60,000
- Crypto Investments: $85,000
- TOTAL ASSETS: $145,000

- Credit Cards: $59,000
- Student Loans: $34,000
- 401(k) Loan: $7,000
- TOTAL LIABILITIES: $100,000

Here is a breakout of my credit cards:

- Chase #1 - $1,900/$2,000 at 26.74% APR
- Chase #2 - $18,400/$18,500 at 20.49% APR
- Chase #3 - $2,960/$3,000 at 19.49% APR
- Chase #4 - $20,900/$20,500 at 24.49% APR
- Discover - $4,115/$4,200 at 22.49% APR
- Citi - $7,660/$8,250 at 19.24% APR
- Target Card - $3,450/$3,500 at 27.15% APR

Here is my credit score so far - it was at 730+ before the loans for investments:

- TransUnion: 591
- Equifax: 581
- Experian: 585

One missed opportunity was that I could have taken profits from my investments when the return was much higher in 2021 to cover my initial investments and pay debt.

Next Steps:
I am thinking about using the $60k in cash to pay off Chase #2 ($18,400) and Chase #4 ($20,900). Invest the remaining ~$20k in crypto to take advantage of dips in the market throughout 2023. When the bull market comes back in a year or so, I would have made my money work for me to pay off the other credit cards including the interest incurred.

Of course, I have the option of using the cash to pay off all of my credit card debt, but then I feel like I would be capping my potential return.

Thoughts?

!!comment!!: Let's hear your stories

Hey guys I know that these past 2 years Moons have been indispensable for many users , I’ve heard stories people (especially in developing countries ) are making more money with Moons  than their salary of their day to day job . Even one of my mate who lives in the US told me he bought a used car ( around $5000) for his fiancè , funny thing he was even unemployed at that particular time . Now here is my biggest question …. What have you guys bought with your moons ? Honest answers only .
!!comment!!: Damn this sub is starting to look more like Australia 🇦🇺 so many sneks

!!comment!!: Kinda glad I sold half my ARB airdrop; didn’t even know I was getting anything until after the fact. A nice surprise indeed! 

Selling half helped me pay off some CC debt, and holding the other half is just a bonus! (Unless it tanks😅)

!!comment!!: Moon trading volume on the up again!
!!comment!!: Holy shit, I did it! I finally did it. I finally got metamask set up and with my moons in it. That was hard for someone like me!  BTW the key part was finding that I needed to uninstall my freshly set up Metamask with it's account and moon token carefully set up, so I could start again by importing my vault wallet instead. Hopefully that's several hours of learning that will come in handy! Thanks for all the help folks.
!!comment!!: What’s a silver of luxury you allow yourself to indulge in in crypto?

!!comment!!: To keep up with Balaji's prediction, the on-day average for Bitcoin has to be around $104k by end of today.
!!comment!!: I just wanna rant for a second. I had around 3.1 eth sitting in robinhood. I know, robinhood bad, but I converted my stocks to it when the market took a fat dump a few months ago. I’m originally from NY but am currently attending med school in Poland. for context, crypto transfers aren’t available in NY on robinhood so I messaged support saying I haven’t lived in NY since Jan 8th to see if I’d be able to enable transfers. whelp that was my mistake because now I got an email saying they’re closing my account, forcing me to liquidate my crypto having held it on their for less than a year. now i’m forced to take a short term capital gains tax or potentially end up losing access to both my account and the crypto stored on it. ok, rant over
!!comment!!: I like seeing Bitcoin go up in value, but for the moment I prefer seeing my amount of Bitcoin go up.

The goal is really just to own 1 BTC. I’m far away but I get a little closer every week.

Cool or overkill?
!!comment!!: Happy Friday, friends! 

Loving all the sneak peeks and the abundance of artists who are participating in Gen 3! There’s going to be so many avatars
!!comment!!: Moons are the monetization and financiarisation of social interactions and genuine bonds among a very sincere and inclusive community of interest. You should give me your moons.
!!comment!!: What do I do with my Algo now that Coinbase paused on interest?
!!comment!!: Whelp, BTC is now above the 200w moving average and bull market support band.

In Q2 2019 it went above both before dropping below both when covid hit in March 2020. Didn't return to being above both until Q2 2020.
!!comment!!: Court cases the next couple months will bring another dip or take us right into $35k territory.

!!comment!!: The global crypto market cap is $1.16T, a 2.21% decrease over the last day.

  
The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $54.77B, which makes a 0.63% decrease.  
  
Bitcoin’s dominance is currently 46.17%, a decrease of 0.00% over the day.
!!comment!!: I like to think my brief week trip to Korea last week was the catalyst for Kwon to panic and get caught.
!!comment!!: So I just got an email from Celsius that they reached a settlement of 72% of your custody account. The funny thing is that most Celsius users don't keep their crypto in custody doing nothing, it's mostly in earn account earning rewards. Settlement is not for Earn account. 


Now here's where I might have gotten lucky because a day before withdrawal locked up I moved my Link into Custody account preparing to withdraw. I checked my email from Celsius showing me my claims and sure enough my Chainlink is in Custody account. So there is actually a chance I can get 72% of my Chainlink back if I opt in the Settlement. 


There's hope for me after all boys!
!!comment!!: Awarded the daily a SNEK, may the markets be green
!!comment!!: Good morning! ☕️ how are we feeling?

Reddit is deprecating the Talk feature, so we will have to find a new home after this episode.

To celebrate over 50 episodes with you here on Reddit, we'll invite a few up to chat with us along the way. Very spicy week ahead, a lot to talk about.

>Silvergate collapsing

>SVB collapsing

>USDC deppeggging and CB stopping redemptions causing a contagion across all stable coins with USDC reserves.

>Algorand and Hedera both got hacked within a week 


And still BTC held onto $20k and bounced through all the FUD...I think its safe to say that 15k was bottom. Congratulations to all the hard headed who stuck around. our suffering will not go in vain.

Finally. After 2 months since I lodged my ticket to report multiple unauthorized transactions made on my CDC Visa card, the case is concluded and CDC have reimbursed me for the funds lost.

Early January I noticed 4 transactions, totalling $287 AUD which I did not make; eventually discovered to be 4 different American dating websites. After some emails back and forth, and verification with their support, and finally lodging the official notice to dispute transactions, it took another month until the case was finally resolved in my favour.

Phew!
!!comment!!: I started buying crypto in February last year, so I've had very little to cheer about up until now. But BTC pumping 10%+ twice in a week is quite exciting, I won't lie.

!!comment!!: this pump is exactly what will happen when banks go bankrupt/economy tanks, crypto/gold rip to moon, fed prints more money, everything ok, prices go down, feels like a test run, bullish on crypto's future as usual, this pump confirms it, hold tight, they cant keep doing this fiat ponzi fractional (with zero fractional reserves per 2020 rule change) banking scam much longer, and we know CBDC's are in the works
!!comment!!: In case anyone was wondering, about 2 hours ago a nice whale withdrew 24 ETH from Coinbase, converted to wETH, and began purchasing moons on SushiSwap:

https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/address/0x74e22bAC2065A4716bC10ad291531539857DF3cE/token-transfers#address-tabs

In total, they now have 175,000 moons.

This large purchase caused moons to pump from around 25c to 30c.

!!comment!!: Been commenting regularly on this sub for 5 years and still not a single moon. For the love of crypto, Can somebody help me get into the moon game. Activated vault. Still nothing 🤷🏻‍♂️
!!comment!!: So PNC Bank passed on buying out SVB. And because no other banks stepped forward, the Treasury Dept, Federal Reserve, and FDIC will issue a loan to cover all SVB customers funds. Basically, they lied and printed more money.

I really wonder if this and coming weeks, more banks start to teeter. If anyone knows anything or heard anything about another collapsing, definitely post it here.  Speak up! Would-be great to outplay our corrupt financial system and punish them for their malfeasance.

!!comment!!: This moon week is my 3rd governance proposal to be approved.

Feeling like I'm making a difference xD
!!comment!!: So the most likely reason for the dump today in Moons price could be a Moons whale getting hacked and his 83k Moons being dumped for ETH on Sushiswap.

Edit: The person who got hacked has a post up right now asking for help. The 83k Moons transaction can be seen on ccmoons website homepage in the 10k+ transactions tab.

!!comment!!: Volume is forming , something is brewing, I think we’re about to taste 26k again
!!comment!!: If you are investing now in crypto, you are still early... But not 10000% return early.

I would say, in my very partial perspective, that is ok to expect a 500% return in 3/4 years so thats the best investment i see out there.
!!comment!!: I just realized that people in this sub are constantly reposting the same news over and over again.
!!comment!!: Elizabeth Warren is demanding that SVB executives return their salaries and bonuses, along with their $80+ million stock sale profits.

!!comment!!: Can’t sleep, might as swell check charts

!!comment!!: Bank stocks crashing -35% while BTC is shining

*Im loving it*
!!comment!!: Over 70k Bitcoin have been sent from exchanges to wallets since the collapse of SVB 🔥
!!comment!!: Seems like 25k is still pretty stubborn. It will be amazing when that number becomes more of a support line, rather than resistance.
!!comment!!: Don’t forget to disconnect/revoke contracts from your wallet after bridging, swapping or minting certain NFTs (some of them, even legit ones make you sign some type of contract at times. Not sure if they have 100% wallet access though.)

Make it a habit! Stay safe and DYOR

!!comment!!: we're having a lot more action in March than I expected
!!comment!!: I don’t get the worry behind BTC not being able to hold 25k. we reached a 9 month high, that’s a good sign imo regardless of what the market does in the short term
!!comment!!: Wish I could see prices on half my phone screen and still be on Reddit on then other half.
!!comment!!: Good Night guys keep on watching the market. Dont let it go down.
!!comment!!: So Paxos is sued for minting BUSD for USD deposits. 

FED is minting $2 Trillion to bail out banks

!!comment!!: I said it once and I’ll say it again: Every stablecoin needs to be pegged to costco hotdogs
!!comment!!: I dont get it. We are on the verge of a 2008 esque crisis. The day before a potential bank run. BTC pumping. Maybe it actually is doing what its supposed to.
!!comment!!: That guy who traded $2million for cents oof. Any updates on that guy
!!comment!!: I’m so proud of myself that I did not panic sell this time. 

I’m gonna call my mom
!!comment!!: This week is going to be epic, for better or worse. If things start cascading, will the Fed pause or cut rates? Will inflation remain hot? Will more banks collapse? Will the Fed have no choice but to inject liquidity into the market? Maybe everything calms down but I’m grabbing my 🍿

!!comment!!: Good day people. Tomorrow will be interesting.

Buckle up boys and girls.

The mind is frigging weird. Anyone else?

!!comment!!: Daily is hard to find coingecko is not working is this a signal for a bull run?
!!comment!!: For anyone who bought the dip. Don’t forget to transfer your coins OFF the exchange! You would be sorry if you were smart enough to make a killing on cheap BTC, just to lose it again because your exchange goes under.
!!comment!!: Good morning daily. Don’t spend all day freaking out over the price action. Leave that to me.
!!comment!!: Did anyone take some profits today?
!!comment!!: So much activity on the daily and green in the charts!!! 

Love the enthusiasm we have and hope y’all enjoying this ride too
!!comment!!: Ah nice a new daily. Honestly didn’t expect to see green today.
!!comment!!: I used to love that feeling waking up during the bull market wondering what crazy prices you might see. 

Hopefully returning to those times in the near future! 

Good night for now.
!!comment!!: Let's see how many comments the daily gets this time!
!!comment!!: Moons snapshot snould happen today?

!!comment!!: Am I seeing things right? Moons going to the moon?

New membership let’s fuckin go, I love this journey I’ve had. First earning moons I had no idea about, getting a double ratio, buying some on metamask then just got two Reddit avatars last night.  This is the experience every person should be able to have in this space.

!!comment!!: BTC 24h high was $26,402

ETH 24h high was $1,779
!!comment!!: So who else tried to search on Reddit whether Reddit was down?
!!comment!!: Middle of the week! We’re getting there folks! Then we can have a breather from these accursed fiat mines
!!comment!!: 
Goddamn these stocks are tearing me a new one. 

The pessimist in me says crypto is just lagging a bit behind and the red sea is imminent.

The optimist in me left in 2018
!!comment!!: Reddit is having a stroke again today it seems
!!comment!!: Good night everyone, the snapshot is only 30 mins, we did our best, congrats to everyone especially to those who opened their vault.
!!comment!!: Anyone else feeling great with that 0.7ish ratio?
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|TT7JW4Qm7uaNW|downsized)

Finally... Reddit... has come back... online!

That means bull run is now confirmed.
!!comment!!: I hear people had to work this afternoon…. 

That’s rough.
!!comment!!: I spend way too much time on here. Thag outage had me struggling
!!comment!!: Yeh, well I'm sick of it when I try to reply to a comment and it appears as its own comment half way up the daily 😑
!!comment!!: Anyone else chained to the fiat mines today and had no idea Reddit was down?  Boss man was extra heavy on the whips today 😭
!!comment!!: I have terrible strep throat but all my coins going up is healing me
!!comment!!: It's finally payday! Which means DCA day has come again
!!comment!!: Just looked at my portfolio and thought something had suddenly caused it to drop by $5k😳

I was looking at it in $USD instead of $AUD.
!!comment!!: LMFAAAAAOOOO someone just parked a van with a BTC Ad infront of Silicon Valley Bank
!!comment!!: The nice thing about holding XRP is you dont really dump much, cause you never pump.
!!comment!!: If CS is saved, btc and alts are gonna rip to the upside
!!comment!!: another day done in the fiat mines! hows your day going?

!!comment!!: Dear all

New Kahoot time  
We’ve had to postpone Kahoot trivia 24 hours forward due to the Reddit outage - new time:

10 pm UTC Wednesday 15 March 2023   
9 am AEDT Thursday 16 March 2023 (for the Aussies)
!!comment!!: I was so bored without reddit
!!comment!!: Thought Reddit pulled a SVB
!!comment!!: I logged into the broken app and my vault wasn’t showing my Moons.  My heart dropped for a second 😳
!!comment!!: Phew, I thought I was ban
!!comment!!: Everybody had a little jump when they didnt knew servers where down and saw cant view this community, atleast my heart dropped
!!comment!!: Well I didn't realize how much time I spend on Reddit until it was down and I had nothing to do. Missed you all ❤️
!!comment!!: I made spaghetti with mushroom and sweet sausage sauce, and donated Plasma for some cash. What did you do during the Great Reddit Outage of ‘23?
!!comment!!: I feel left out. Didn’t even know Reddit was down.
!!comment!!: I just looked at the CCMoons Karma estimator and I don't think it's counting up the number of comments for today since the outage correctly. 

Did anyone else notice this?
!!comment!!: It turns out BTC was a bank failure hedge all alone.
!!comment!!: I can take big red days, but reddit going down? hell naw
!!comment!!: I don't think anyone here would fall for this (then again...) but just wanted to warn people that some users have been scammed by selling their Reddit avatars to other users who contacted them via DMs, who sent them Goerli testnet ETH, instead of mainnet ETH.

There was a post about it in the avatar trading sub, although I can't link it here.

Many of us have done successfully p2p  trades with one another through the DMs, but it's always a risk, especially if you don't know what you're doing, so general advice is to stick to OpenSea
!!comment!!: I survived the great Reddit crash of March 2023 by sleeping right through it
!!comment!!: Im slightly embarrassed to ask this, but what exactly does it mean when you hear the phrase “$XX in ETH were burned”?
!!comment!!: The one time I have a comment going viral in a hot thread and of course Reddit crashes lol 

Me and crypto keep going at it
!!comment!!: Drinking a cup of Sakura green tea au fait at Doutor, Japan and counting my blessings this Reddit is working again so I can get my crypto news
!!comment!!: Good morning everyone 😊

Glad reddit is back 😁 went to bed early last night because the site was down and I didn't have anything better to do lol
!!comment!!: This pump was nice, but I am still far from breaking even..
!!comment!!: Happy snapshot day! I’m quite excited as it’s my first one 🤓 Let’s hope the ratio won’t be too bad. What are you thinking?
!!comment!!: Guys I bought the dip. Garlic dip from the pizza shop
!!comment!!: what happening in the financial world
!!comment!!: It’s okay, we can’t pump every day. Took some profits and I’ll be ready to put them back in
!!comment!!: Credit Suisse is sliding, but if you look at its performance over the past 3 years it's literally a shitcoin 

Down 80%+
!!comment!!: Btc is going to go up another 15% with all these banks failing
!!comment!!: Idk for you guys but for me Reddit isn't working very good today
!!comment!!: BTC is like the light in end of the tunel
!!comment!!: Why anyone would go long or short right now is beyond me.
!!comment!!: For the ones staking Eth at Coinbase.

https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1636047272357101569

>5/ If you’d like to unstake, Coinbase will begin taking unstaking requests about 24 hours after the upgrade completes. All unstaking requests are processed on-chain, and we’ll pass the unstaked funds and staking rewards to you once released by the Ethereum protocol

Upgrade is in 1 month or so
!!comment!!: I say we take off and nuke the banks from orbit.
!!comment!!: For those with hardware wallets. Do you take advantage of the optional passphrase feature ? Why or why not
!!comment!!: It pains me to say it but this dump makes more sense to me. Crypto is still way to entangled with fiat banking.
Credits are still an mostly unsolved problem in crypto in my opinion. I think we need a real stable coin not fiat pegged.
!!comment!!: BTC proving once again it is king
!!comment!!: My target for this year is 10k moons
!!comment!!: CCIP-053 is out ✅✅

!!comment!!: Ccmoons karma estimator is really on point. Salute to the person/persons who created it
!!comment!!: Finally everyone is realising that crypto is better than banks
!!comment!!: So basically Bitcoin already saw it's price pump before the CPI price. Prices have dropped to same same levels they were before the CPI release.
!!comment!!: Waiting for the pump…

![gif](giphy|Emg9qPKR5hquI)
!!comment!!: Naturally, I got 666 karma last distribution. Pleasantly surprised the ratio was still at least 0.7417 considering the increase in activity.
!!comment!!: We’re all addicted to Reddit confirmed.
!!comment!!: It was very rude for reddit to go down as we dropped to 24k. I wanted to panic with you guys.
!!comment!!: Is it snapshot day already again? 0.0
!!comment!!: Just to be clear, free money for poor people caused inflation so they had to make it impossible to borrow money and make sure a lot of us lost our jobs so we'd stop spending but then a bunch of billionaires grossly mismanaged their portfolios and the money printer is fired up immediately to make them whole. I have that right?
!!comment!!: Fun fact : Moons outperformed the S&P 500, NASDAQ, BTC and ETH, and every single bank stocks in the last 12 months.
!!comment!!: Credit Suisse about to go under
!!comment!!: Reddit’s finally working again. Woohoo
!!comment!!: Missed out on some moons with reddit down all day!
!!comment!!: anyone has an issue with mobile app on ios? for some reason comments won't load
!!comment!!: Issues with logging into Reddit today ... seeing "You can't view this community" always brings the freak out factor 🙂
!!comment!!: Well that was fun checking if it was back up every 10 mins.
!!comment!!: 'morning! 

Bring back 26k!
!!comment!!: Alright.. soo how about the next mega pump we send ETH over $2k again, feels like I’ve been waiting 2 years!
!!comment!!: Oh!  Write down your seed phrase folks!!! 

Adopt 12 cats and name them each a word in your seed phrase. 

Have 12 kids…. All named with seed phrase words….

Get tattoo of seed phrase on butt. 

Write it down.
!!comment!!: yes, slide back for a little correction while i wait for my money to hit the bank due to an ach delay over a cb.
!!comment!!: Welcome back Reddit. I thought I lost you forever 😢
!!comment!!: Damn I thought the cyber attacks got us
!!comment!!: Moonfarmers lost income during reddit down time
!!comment!!: The extent to which this outage bothered me is concerning.
!!comment!!: So they finally tried shutting Reddit On and Off and it worked..  We are back online 😁
!!comment!!: What's the best way to store the seed phrase for your hardware wallet? Wrong answer only
!!comment!!: Finally we are back here my friends. Have been missing you all for a couple of hours.
!!comment!!: Any guesses on the moons ratio ? I have a feeling the outage is going to throw a wrench into things.
!!comment!!: Did Reddit crash bitcoin or did bitcoin crash Reddit?
!!comment!!: My dear daily general discussion , i miss you

!!comment!!: Swaps to BTC- *crashes*

Swaps to USDC- *depegs*

Swaps to USD- *rampant inflation*

Time to buy precious metals
!!comment!!: Coinbase:

"We are temporarily pausing USDC:USD conversions over the weekend while banks are closed. During periods of heightened activity, conversions rely on USD transfers from the banks that clear during normal banking hours. When banks open on Monday, we plan to re-commence conversions."

LOL
!!comment!!: Never thought I’d see USDC depeg, but here we are…
!!comment!!: Coinbase pauses conversion between USDC and USD for the weekend.
!!comment!!: I don't see the point of buying USDC at this levels. 

You risk your capital for a 10% possible upside. Literally buy anything else you'd have better risk/reward ratio.
!!comment!!: We are witnessing history guys.
!!comment!!: In completely unrelated news to what’s going on, a small update that I now display an image of your avatar whenever you search on https://ccmoons.com/estimator
!!comment!!: I've been through 3 full cycles and in my interpretation this is the most wild bear I've been through in totality, Ust, Gemini, voyager, Ftx,Usdc presumably, I know mT. Gox is the gold standard, and the hash wars,but this is getting real at a pace that's very confusing.Ehat too play what not too play?
!!comment!!: Bitcoin is back over $20k at least! Bull run confirmed 👍
!!comment!!: People not able to convert USDC to USD, and hence they are buying more crypto like BTC. We can see $22k BTC or even more if this continues.
!!comment!!: Probably shouldn't fight this feeling anymore

!!comment!!: 1. Circle confirms $3.3B stuck with Silicon Valley Bank
2. Coinbase suspends selling USDC
3. Selloff drains Curve pool
4. Binance suspends USDC to BUSD conversions
5. USDC @ \~ 0.92836 on Kucoin right now
!!comment!!: I pussied out and converted my USDC into EUR taking a 5% loss. I've already dodged the UST bullet converting UST to USDC last time, feels like they're coming after my money lol
!!comment!!: So tether is now the most trusted stable coin?! What the actual fuck lol
!!comment!!: If you have USDC, take the 10% loss now. Not worth the risk. I did the same with UST and watched it crashing to 2c after. Best decision ever.
!!comment!!: Word on the street is JPM is going to buy out svb. Chances are this will all blow over in a few days and give the fed the fear it needs to see things are finally breaking. 

Remind me 3 days!
!!comment!!: In the last 12 months,

- We survived LUNA.
- We survived 3 Arrows.
- We survived Celsius,BlockFi and Voyager.
- We survived FTX.
- We survived Genesis/DCG.
- We survived BUSD.
- We survived USDC.

We definitely deserve a bull market.

!!comment!!: USDC/ USDT @ 0.96398 on Kucoin right now!
!!comment!!: Okay guys, I have to sleep but I'll let you guard the charts for me. I hope I don't wake up with a USDC collapse but I'll be cautiously optimistic and say that it'll repeg. Good night to all!
!!comment!!: Anybody else also watch the Luna collapse live?  This is very reminiscent.
!!comment!!: Hoping that my 0.9 USDC order gets filled

So I can make an easy 10% when it repegs to $1
!!comment!!: Coinbase pausing conversion is NOT a confident signal.
!!comment!!: Who else thinks this bank collapse will lead to more crypto adoption? I kinda anticipated this so far.

!!comment!!: I just sold 85% of my portfolio in the last 5 minutes.  I am not going to risk this.
!!comment!!: When the sub hated usdt and loved usdc , I should have known.
!!comment!!: Despite USDC sales being blocked, I was able to use my Coinbase card and purchase an amazon gift card for the remaining USDC balance that I had left in my account.  Not the most elegant solution...but it will do!
!!comment!!: Are you as stressed as me? Cause im sweating bullet sover here staring at the USDC chart. Im going to help out:

!!comment!!: I think the dump might occur once USDC stops depegging.  Because continuous demegging means USDC -> BTC.  The whales will wait for USDC to stabilize before taking down the entire market.
!!comment!!: My prediction. 

&#x200B;

1.  Some time this weekend, USDC will move back up to like 90-95 cents level. 
2. BTC will go up and carry the alts when this happens, and everyone will be euphoric. 
3. At that point, Bitcoin will dump hard to 18-19K.
!!comment!!: Honestly, I’m not even gonna worry about it. I’m just gonna go to sleep and I’m sure *everything* will be fine by the morning. 

Or a total shit show but either way can’t stress over what I can’t control I guess.
!!comment!!: Be careful.  You have hundred of millions of dollars of BTC that was forced into BTC from USDC right now.  The whales are probably going to look to sell.
!!comment!!: Moons a re up though lol. I think theyre becoming one of the safest options out there to hold cash in 😆
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Idk why everyone is so worried? This is the most centralized part of crypto failing. I call this a win for decentralization.
!!comment!!: Man I have a bad feeling… SBF was just the beginning
!!comment!!: We are experiencing the rare quintuple of getting fucked.

Inflation gets your savings

Rates ruin your stocks

Banks ruin your crypto

And all this FUD ruins the Karma/Moon ratio for this month.

And I’m here to ruin your day.

So yes quintuple fucked.
!!comment!!: Also, the market reaction to the usdc depeg is very weak. Maybe cause its the weekend?
!!comment!!: I'm glad I picked the only true stable coin: Cardano
!!comment!!: WTF is going on with the USDC chart????
!!comment!!: This is weird. I thought Coinbase showed proof of reserves and full backing of USDC?

Wtf is going on.
!!comment!!: USDC isn't the only one depegging right now. DAI, PAX, GUSD are also not at 1.00.
!!comment!!: Here's a quote that aged like milk:

"However, it's important to note that the likelihood of a USDC depeg is relatively low, as it is backed by a significant amount of reserves and is considered to be one of the more reliable stablecoins in the market."
!!comment!!: So there is a good chance that BTC will moon on Monday because lot of people will sell their stable coins and buying BTC
!!comment!!: Look, just buy as much Bitcoin as you can and you'll be fine. See? Crypto is actually very simple.
!!comment!!: The degenerates will be slaughtered to the last one.

The curious will flee under the terror.

The faithful will be tested again and again.

The knowledgeable will bathe in blood.

Stack Bitcoin. 👑
!!comment!!: Maybe I'm just speaking too soon but all things considered things look... Fine?

This is pretty much what my "apocalypse black swan" event looked like in my head, at least it looked something like this.
!!comment!!: well dca day today ! ready 2 buy some extra eth love.it
!!comment!!: Am I seeing this right? Huobi BTC is $100k on coingecko. *BTC to $100k isn’t a meme!*

Edit: Link to coingecko

!!comment!!: anyone else got that eerie feeling that shit is gonna hit the fan this summer?
!!comment!!: Imagine the bank run once Silicon Valley Bank opens on Monday morning. People trying to save their money.
!!comment!!: Joined the cold wallet club and moved most of my assets off exchanges. Kind of nerve wracking but feels good too.
!!comment!!: Good morning 😃 daily! It’s 9 am here in Australia Sunday morning. 

Looks like the market is slowly stabilizing. Coins are repegging. But it’s early days!

A reminder that the MoonPlace art competition closes soon on Sunday 12 March 2023 6 pm EST, 11 pm UTC (Monday 13 March 2023 10 am AEDT my time). 

That’s 24 hours away!

Go nominate and vote! Snapshot of the canvas will be done then. 

See you all later!
!!comment!!: We ll see all coming fine next week. Don’t make anything in panic!
!!comment!!: I may be poor but I'm also ugly.
!!comment!!: Quick everyone! 

Convert your USDC to moons! Lets see how high we can drive it.
!!comment!!: Jokes on you guys, my USDC are locked in Celsius
!!comment!!: Hey partners! Today i have my first moon!!! Thank you all !!
celebrate small achievements to become big achievements in the future
!!comment!!: The market will rebound after I sell all my video games and audio equipment to buy crypto. It'll be a huge green candle

Have a great weekend everyone!
!!comment!!: Probably still early but well done to those who braved the dip. Hope we get more green days... 🤑

Until JPowell's shitshow spoils things again. 🤐
!!comment!!: I know I stay forever bullish on BTC, which I should be practical & realize that may not always be the case BUT…

I do feel like with current events that are transpiring, people are slowly losing faith in the traditional financial system & will start accumulating precious metals & crypto.

2 co-workers signed up to Coinbase today & bought their first BTC
!!comment!!: Everything gonna be alright guys. Stick to the game plan.
!!comment!!: BTC is the only true and real stable coin. Stop chasing all USD forked coins..
!!comment!!: Maybe we should all chip in and buy Coingecko a new server. It can’t handle the slighest bit of excitement.
!!comment!!: Picking the right time to buy the dip

![gif](giphy|BmmfETghGOPrW)
!!comment!!: Nice! I went out for 4 hours and BTC to 20.5k and Moons to 22c. 

Should I go back out again?
!!comment!!: I have a feeling I’m going to go to sleep with shorts and wake up to massive profits and it won’t even matter because the exchange I’m using will have stopped withdrawals
!!comment!!: Imagine being in a part of the world just waking up right now to see USDC depegging and not knowing the back story?
!!comment!!: Floor on The Eyes is steadily rising.  


Maybe I'll consider listing my duplicate in a while.
!!comment!!: 👀 Watching the USDC / USDT pair drop like a rock. Usually I only see my alts go down like this.
!!comment!!: Another weekend with people doing TA on stable coins. *Fun times in crypto!*
!!comment!!: Exit USDC gonna drive up crypto prices just like exit from MTGOX drive up BTC in 2011.  History rhymes.
!!comment!!: Man if btc drops to $10k, I’m mortgaging my house to go all in
!!comment!!: $3.3 billion out of $40 billion of USDC reserves stuck in Silicon Valley Bank is not good but thankfully not horrific, since SVB still has a ton of assets to cover major clients. I assume Circle (USDC)  will take a 3-4% hit in their reserves *at worst*? Unless something goes horribly wrong with the strategy to liquidate assets, which obviously is always a possibility.

!!comment!!: All I see is great buying prices
!!comment!!: Im just asking for a bull market.
!!comment!!: Straight red for 3 weeks. Tis but a scratch 💀
!!comment!!: Glad I have no kids so I can be this reckless with my finances
!!comment!!: Food was overrated anyway

!!comment!!: Everyday when I wake up a set a goal for the day.

!!comment!!: If the bull rly returns and some a-hole tells me i got lucky and how easy it was, i will punch him straight in the face.
!!comment!!: BTC going on sale for my cake day!!
!!comment!!: just lost $700 of ETH for pasting wrong address (Clipboard malware). Silly me for not double checking. These malware really scary. It does not change your address everyrime. Just occasionally. Reboot it is 😭😭
!!comment!!: Welp, at least we can disconnect for a while. No point looking at the charts for a while.
!!comment!!: This pull back is nothing. I'd be worried if we go below 15k. This is nothing people. Good luck with the alts tho haha.
!!comment!!: Just a couple days ago someone here was disappointed they missed out on a "fire sale". Little did they know what was to come. 💀
!!comment!!: I'm depressed, but I know better days are coming soon

!!comment!!: Not a fun day when Turkish Lira outperforms your portfolio.

Crypto: well I’ll half the price then
!!comment!!: Looks like we’re about to get another chance at some cheapies.

!!comment!!: Should’ve spent my paycheck on crystal meth instead of magic internet money
!!comment!!: So, we're back in it for the tech again, right?
!!comment!!: People need to realize that cryptocurrency is pain. I have been in cryptocurrency for almost six years, and we have only had around six months of price discovery during that time. Cryptocurrency spends 90% of the time going down or sideways.
!!comment!!: That's the way she goes boys. Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesnt, cause that's the fuckin' way she goes.
!!comment!!: At least we’re all in it together lol
!!comment!!: This month in crypto…

-Silvergate collapses….largest fiat transaction platform for all of crypto goes down with it 


-Signature Bank (the only alternative bank willing to work with crypto) are under regulatory investigation for money laundering and fraud


-Binance and CZ are under multiple investigations for money laundering, bank fraud, and co-mingling customer funds, and using a US dummy entity to hide its involvement with China

!!comment!!: 2022 was the bear. 2023 is looking like the crab. What more TA do you need (with the addition of the impending halving) to see that 2024 is probably the bull year. Im predicting it starts somewhat early, though. Like halfway through this year the crab starts getting all spikey and grows a little oxtail. Might get its nose pierced if its feeling cute IDK.
!!comment!!: Geez...credit card, auto, and mortgage defaults are piling up. And BRICS nations are edge closer to their own currency. Markets look ripe to crash this month...will crypto be a good hedge, or will it tumble and fall?
!!comment!!: I mined fiat for 15 hours today and I still haven’t left work. Can’t wait to sell this shit for some crypto.
!!comment!!: What are your views on Hook protocol?
!!comment!!: My crypto bags are full. I don't want to get more and now all I can do is wait for 2025. Boringggg

!!comment!!: I bought Bitcoin yesterday. Sorry guys.
!!comment!!: One limit buy order executed 😃
!!comment!!: I have earned 8 moons since Sushiswap liquidity rewards went live. Neat! 🍻
!!comment!!: How low do you think BTC will drop? Will we “attack” 21K?
!!comment!!: Some of the shit in this sub feels like you are browsing r/safemoon sometimes. It's brain rotting.
!!comment!!: 4-hr charts look nasty. Like Requiem For a Dream nasty.
!!comment!!: Daily reminder to always double check the address you're sending into even if you copy pasted the address. I just got scammed for $700 from clipboard malware. Silly me, should've double check.. Well, Shit happens I guess
!!comment!!: Uff, and again: waking up, a lot of coins have 2-7% lost. wtf :(   


every... day... the same :(
!!comment!!: Call me a mad march hare but I see Bitcoin more likely hitting 25k than 20k.
!!comment!!: Watching everyone comment on the crypto sales tax as if they made $1,000,000 trading that year 🤡
!!comment!!: still down 60% but whatever

!!comment!!: Anybody else from a 3rd world/ developing country here ?
!!comment!!: Got a sick pump in the gym to compensate for the lack of pumps in the market.
!!comment!!: Am I the only one who sees all this as an opportunity to buy cheap?  Many here lament that they missed the opportunity to buy cheap.  Now is their chance.
!!comment!!: Does anyone else remember getting gifted 1k+ moons by some random redditor here just for posting on the daily back in April 2022?

I miss that guy. I hope he's doing well with his fat bag of moons.
!!comment!!: I never liked having money anyways...
!!comment!!: I'm fantasizing about having sold my entire bag at 25k and being able to buy lower now. Anyone else?

!!comment!!: When market goes up, I feel I haven't invested enough.

When it goes down, it feels I've overinvested.

I need to break out of this psychology, torturing myself for no reason.
!!comment!!: I told myself when my crypto holdings got to a certain level, I’d switch to a Ledger for protection.    I was very close.  Looks like I don’t have to worry about that now.
!!comment!!: Rsi on 4 hour chart reaching the 8 November Ftx crash lows. Panic much

!!comment!!: Stocks are getting rocked too guys; there’s definitely correlation today
!!comment!!: Ouch. Waking up to this I should just go back to bed.
!!comment!!: Market is dumping like it just ate Taco Bell
!!comment!!: Well I’m off to bed. Don’t crash the market while I’m gone.
!!comment!!: Welp, people were saying they wanted another opportunity to load up… here’s your chance!! I’m probably gonna wait a bit to see how far we fall.  NO PEACE in the crypto space!! 😂

!!comment!!: Who knew that 2020 and 2021 would be the most corrupt,  mismanaged and poorly executed bull run ever recorded for crypto? It'll be years before any of these fake leveraged gains are reached to break even if you bought in 2021 especially.  Literally every day some crypto company's like I actually lied we don't have a sustainable business.  
 
Domino effect of degen.
!!comment!!: Wow, a freefall. No bounce even a small one.

That was a strange 5 years to say the least

!!comment!!: I'm thinking we bounce after the higher unemployment rate.
!!comment!!: Started with $200 at beginning of 2020. Flipped, traded and  had 44k in my portfolio oct 2021 during the bull run. watched it all go down slowly after and now fully liquidated. Learnt my lesson and ready to buy in slowly now and wait for next run.
!!comment!!: Nothing like a dippy dip on my day of birth 🎂
!!comment!!: got a feeling we are about to dip even further
!!comment!!: You guys ever think about how crazy it is that we discuss prices going up and down daily without our control? It’s like having a daily thread for the weather and freaking out about a sunny day.
!!comment!!: When BTC almost hit $20k in 2017 it was 76k Lira.  
When BTC bounces around $20k in 2023 it is 379k Lira.

!!comment!!: Remember guys, the pain of a bear market doesn’t come close to the pain of not having your bags packed in a bull market. This is the way. You know what you have to do. Now smile. SMILE!!
!!comment!!: Spent half of my spare fiat earlier. Hardly surprising to find out now then that that wasn't the bottom -- but that's precisely why I still have the other half on hold.

Can't time the market!
!!comment!!: I know long term is fine but damn, the daily charts of BTC is depressing. 

Oh and all the other ones too.
!!comment!!: I’ve been growing chillies for some time now, from seed. And I’m finally starting to see some chillies growing. 

Im so happy! I know it’s not crypto related at all. But I thought I’d share it
!!comment!!: Markets were shit today but at least I got to talk to the cute girl at my gym today
!!comment!!: So when moon distribution happens there's the general ratio for everybody based on how active the sub was and then there's that CCIP 030 Karma Multiplier based on if the person retained their moons or sold more than 25%. Am I effected by both these ratios at the same time? Say a user has a KM of 0.30 because he sold and then the subreddit ratio is 0.80. How are both applied?

!!comment!!: I literally caught a falling knife yesterday. Chefs knife I received as a gift, hand forged in Japan and purchased from the smith in Japan. If it hit the floor from the drop off the counter it would have snapped.

!!comment!!: U.S. bank regulators seize Silicon Valley Bank in largest bank failure since the Great Recession —

And people still ask are we heading into a recession..WAKE UP we are already  in one.
!!comment!!: So Silicon Valley Bank has offically been shut down by regulators and the FDIC will protect anyone's deposits by up to $250,000.  The problem is, I'm sure many of the start ups had way more than $250,000 in their SVB account.

Just a factual reminder to never trust the Banks, Government, Regulators, etc. HODL Bitcoin and a few choice ALTs off chain, and you can completely escape this madness.
!!comment!!: Got to love these tests of patience during the bear market.

When you set your expectations to a drop down to $3k BTC then you'll find these small dips to be less remarkable.
!!comment!!: I love how in the bear market I can spot individual names and might find them in other posts or other dailies. It’s really cool having this integrated community. I am going to miss the bear market. When the bull market starts all the bots and delusional investors pour back into r/cc

We need a Hopium fix for BTC and ETH asap
!!comment!!: Lord snek in the daily… green incoming

!!comment!!: Added Total Supply and DEX TVL ($ in sushiswap and rcpswap liquidity pools) to the homepage of [ccmoons.com](https://ccmoons.com). Think those round out the homepage info nicely
!!comment!!: Just want to give a big virtual hug to all my algorand people who lost coins to the hack 🥺

Opsec is critically overlooked and misunderstood in this space.

You’re only as safe as your last transaction.

You’re never truly safe in ANY hot wallet.

You’re only safe in a cold wallet if you don’t sign fraudulent transactions.

I have 3 types of addresses for each of my coins on my ledger.

Hot: Receive coins from CEXs to this address first. Connect it to risky DEXs, sign nft signatures, will post this address publicly, etc. Keep the balance low.

Lukewarm: Send coins from hot address to this one. It’s connected to sushi, opensea, metamask, uniswap. All the “safe” dexs and protocols.

Cold: only receives from lukewarm wallet. Never interacts with anything. Never signs anything. Coins just sit there until it’s time to move them out in the bull run.

Edit: as for the hack. Sometimes… the coins are just gone.. There’s risk with everything in crypto. Self custody (or multi sig) in a fresh wallet is the best chance you have at “safety” but some things are out of your control.
!!comment!!: Good Morning! I hope you all have a great day ahead 😊
!!comment!!: Crazy how BTC is basically flatlining
!!comment!!: Bull, Bear, don’t care.  
  
Still stacking.

!!comment!!: \*Checks Wallet\*  


Meh.... maybe tomorrow.
!!comment!!: *Decimate* is based on the Latin word for the number ten. The ancient Romans dealt with mutiny or cowardice in the army by selecting one man in ten, chosen by lot, for punishment, which normally meant death. 

Which crypto out of ten cryptocurrencies would be the first to be decimated in your opinion?
!!comment!!: The longer you are in invested in crypto, the more you move towards BTC.
!!comment!!: I got a good amount of my favorite alts the last few months. Now it’s time to focus on ETH & the stock market to add more stability to the portfolio
!!comment!!: Sigh. Algo see myself out.
!!comment!!: I’m just HODLing onto my losses at this point. Don’t start your crypto journey during a bull run kids. Wait for times like these.
!!comment!!: This week marks the 11th anniversary since I was first introduced to Bitcoin. It was a coworker who tried to convince me to invest in Bitcoin back then and suggested that I should invest around 5,000 NOK, which was equivalent to around 850 USD at the time.
Or 150+ BTC…

I laughed him off, and didn't see the potential in Bitcoin at the time. After all, back in 2012 Bitcoin was still in its infancy, and very few people had heard of it. It was hard to imagine that a digital currency could have any real-world value or use.

Yeah.. that’s a story for the grandkids.. #legend
!!comment!!: BUSD MCap down to $8.4 billion.  


Crazy to think it was double that just a few weeks ago.
!!comment!!: Grayscale had their initial oral arguments today vs the SEC, after suing the SEC for rejecting Grayscale's spot BTC ETF.

The judges on the US Court of Appeals were grilling the SEC who seemed on the defensive the whole time. The judges questioned how the SEC could approve the Futures ETF, but not approve the Spot BTC ETF - which rely on the same data.

Looks very favorable for GBTC.
!!comment!!: In 08 I was like 14 watching the world crumble. I was so mad the bankers could
Get away with being so irresponsible and then shorting it the whole way down.

A few years later trolling through 4chan I heard of this thing called bitcoin. It was the ultimate fuck you to the banks and government. I did some research, and it was so cyberpunk I loved it. I needed to get in. 

After spending a few hours trying to figure out how to buy and where to store, I decided it was too complicated and not worth it. This was like 2010-2011. It was around a dollar then. Now I slap myself when I have to go to work these days
!!comment!!: The most bullish potential news.

 A judge overturning the Greyscale decision thereby approving a spot BTC ETF.

And 

Ripple vs SEC win at summary judgement
!!comment!!: Can I pay a Reddit NFT avatar with reddit coins or "only ca$h"?
!!comment!!: If BTC shoots a massive green candle up to 100k right now, are you selling or waiting to see if it goes up more?

!!comment!!: If it were up to me I would get a second job right now to investe more into BTC when it is low.   
But I have a family so it is not really up to me, DCA whatever we can safely miss will have to do.
!!comment!!: Goodmorning from barcelona. Nice weather means green dayss ahead..

!!comment!!: Buying MATIC under $1 is comparable to catching a Mewtwo with just a basic ass PokeBall
!!comment!!: 4h 15m until Powell opens his mouth. At least we will see a bit of volatility

!!comment!!: Today is the day that Bitcoin goes to 0$, I knew it!

!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Is it more safe to keep your Moons on reddit vault than exchange?
!!comment!!: 2+ years in Crypto and just sold a small bag for the first time ever as I needed the cash. Been a rough few months. It was DOGE and only around $200 worth. Only a very small percentage of my portfolio, but still felt strange!!!
!!comment!!: We are addicts. At least recognise that.
!!comment!!: Sorry if this is a stupid question..... but can anyone just draw a picture and make it into a nft?
!!comment!!: What's the highest Moon tip you've ever received?

Happy days 🍻
!!comment!!: The new stickied post about providing $Moon liquidity on sushi is a must see.

Quality visual walkthroughs.
!!comment!!: Bitcoin has already completed the most difficult task, which is people believing in Bitcoin as an item of value, driving adoption. Adoption continues to grow daily, which will only drive Bitcoins value higher.

People compare Bitcoin to tulip mania…I can name a million reasons why there is zero comparison, but let’s just look at time frame alone…Tulip mania bubble lasted from 1634-1637.

That’s 3 years…let’s even make it 6 years, since the average life span has pretty much doubled since those times…BTC has still been rolling for over doubled that time span.
!!comment!!: Boys you know we’re fucked in the head when we’re all excited for prices to go up and simultaneously excited for them to go down lmao. Absolute fucking crackheads, all of us.
!!comment!!: Look everyone asking for green and bull market!

Ask yourself the question if you have accumulated enough? If not, you will also be the guy buying at the higher prices trying to chase a higher profit.

Me I am nowhere near the amount I wanted to buy, so I honestly hope for 1 more year of bear to buy.

That way I can be ready for the bull market and ride it out. 

Now is the time money is made, not when the bull market starts.
!!comment!!: Is it too much to ask BTC to rise 10% today so I can use the profit to order the Lego Rivendell set?
!!comment!!: Not sure why I feel this way, but 24k at the moment seems as impossible as 69k.
!!comment!!: My students sat for Paper 1 n Paper 2 for their English examination today. Finished marking Paper 1 just now. Can’t wait to finish marking Paper 2 so that I can resume my regular shitposting routine!
!!comment!!: stocks are looking great, let’s hope bitcoin can do the same
!!comment!!: Such a tight crabbing range that an $80 bump looks like a god candle 🤣
!!comment!!: Bitcoin sprouting a bit of cheeky green on the chart. More power to you buddy.

I want to ask a question about the LP!

!!comment!!: It always feels bad when you don't take profits at certain price point because you think it'll keep going up, but at the same time, you can't blame yourself for not knowing it'll dump after reaching that price point. What matters is that you keep yourself invested in the projects you believe in and just keep accumulating until the time is right.

Keep DCA-ing and HODL-ing. Don't mind the present noise. Extend and widen your time-frame and you'll be thankful you did so. Have a great day, y'all!

!!comment!!: Something in another thread got me interested and I started looking up info on the stock market in the 1920’s. There was no crypto then, so I wondered what was considered new and shiny. 

I happened upon this analysis and it’s long and boring and probably no one wants to read it, but it discusses the ways in which innovation contribute to the stock market.  If you feel like reading a 45(!) page discussion (or falling asleep to one) here’s the link:

https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/stocksinnovation_a7c774bc-c552-450d-b0f4-a5eb04634d9c.pdf

If you want to search it, the title is: Stock Market Swings and the Value of Innovation, 1908-1929

It’s on the Harvard website.

Posting it here because crypto is innovative and new, and some people here are also into the stocks and whatnot.

So I'm asking myself...does XRP have any long-term value, or am I just holding on to it to capitalize on a favorable ruling? I'm all about the long-term. So...does it have long-term value?

He relocated down to Australia just over ten years ago but one of his last parties or events he went to before leaving New York had a small Bitcoin sponsor and when you entered the building they gave everyone a usb with like 100 free Bitcoin on it. He said when he was leaving at the end of the night the whole floor was just littered with USBs. He said he now feels so stupid for not keeping his and throwing it away.

!!comment!!: Seems like the good moon news are spreading around .. above 20 cents now again
!!comment!!: Good morning daily 👋👋 Don’t spend all day freaking out over the price action. Leave that to me.
!!comment!!: Thought this is interesting- If you look at the whales’ account, they’re not accumulating now. They’re selling. One of the top wallets this subreddit mentions every now and then last bought their bitcoin back in November. They have been selling it since then, and have yet to buy a significant amount. 

They’re loading their fiat for something.

[The wallet I was referring to.](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1LQoWist8KkaUXSPKZHNvEyfrEkPHzSsCd) It is assumed that this wallet is connected to a few more (2-3).

If it does happen, it'll be good for prices in the next bull run, but also sad at the same time if gambling with shitcoins is seen as the only way to move forward financially.
!!comment!!: Not financial advise: buy btc let the whales cry
!!comment!!: What are some deleterious effects of crypto on your life?
!!comment!!: A slug , a snail and a crab "walk" into a  bar.
!!comment!!: Cannot believe we don't have 29 feb

Do we think now we've seen 25k (only just) there's a little more faith in the market and sub 20k is seen as a good opportunity once again?
!!comment!!: Is here anyone who just wanna see BTC at $100k and sell it. Just wanna buy a small house and Live a peaceful life with your family?

!!comment!!: I honestly believe $16500 is the Bitcoin bottom…I think the collapse of FTX pushed us to the bottom. I don’t see rates or any macroeconomics taking us below that…even the SEC has declared that BTC is not a security.

The market can lose a lot of MC, and a lot of alts can bleed out, but I don’t see BTC going below $16500

Keep in mind that I know nothing lol
!!comment!!: Real talk 

dunno if it’s the bear market getting to me, but I feel like my life is stuck on repeat and I’m going further into debt daily.  ( due to career change and toddler/wife sucking all my monies up)

!!comment!!: What has been your most defining crypto moment since you entered the space?
!!comment!!: So are we gonna take a hit twice?  Once for the "fear of bigger fed rate hikes", and then again when the hikes actually happen?

Our volumes in the last 24h were $80B
!!comment!!: I wonder who controls Gensler’s strings? His BS statements on crypto do nothing except pump or dump the markets. I’d he’s serious about regulating crypto, why isn’t he working with Congress to craft regulations?

At this point, any new law is good as long as the market knows what to expect.

If you want to see this yourself, head to [this URL](https://www.sushi.com/earn/arb-nova:0xd6c821b282531868721b41badca1f1ce471f43c5), click "TVL", and select 1M for one month view.

!!comment!!: One thing this bear market is teaching me is patience. Holy shit. I just wanna be financially free.
!!comment!!: At the end of the year I’m opening a bar here in Cambodia and intend to accept crypto. Planning on accepting 5 different types. So far I’m going with BTC and ETH (because they’re the most recognised and what I’d most like to stack) and NANO (because it’s instant and has no transaction fees and there is good wallet options). What other 2 should I take and why?

!!comment!!: Coinbase Cloud's MATIC validator stopped signing checkpoints for \~8 hours last night and is at risk of forced unstake.

[https://staking.polygon.technology/validators/142](https://staking.polygon.technology/validators/142)

**228,832,851.43 MATIC** is locked up to this validator and could potentially be unstaked in the near future. This is one of the top 10 Validators on the MATIC network. It is important to note that that vast majority of this staked MATIC is staked by less than 10 wallets, however. 

Over 100 million MATIC is staked by 3 addresses alone. I don't expect this to have a negative price impact as these stakers are very likely to just move their stakes.

!!comment!!: Does commenting or posting give you more moons?

!!comment!!: Cant believe if we hold 23k after this drop, think the weekend give us a lot of buying opportunities
!!comment!!: I knew something was up, I was getting dangerously close to making some real money a few days ago
!!comment!!: just to be clear:  gdp is down, inflation continues to remain \~5% (much above the 2% goal of the FED) and the job market continues to stay stubbornly strong.  there's definitely no reason to panic, but wall street will certainly pull back for at least a week or two before forgetting all of this and getting all pumped up again.
!!comment!!: What’s everyone’s plans for the weekend? Gotta be something other than degen activities going on 😂
!!comment!!: The U.S. court ruled that these emojis “🚀📈💰” are investment advice.                                                                                                  Someone tells this kid to go play away guys🤦🏾‍♂️🤡

!!comment!!: Happy Friday all, the charts are red but the beers are cold!
!!comment!!: The 2024 Bitcoin halving will be the most important Halving of all time. Bitcoin is about to become the hardest asset in the world with certainty. The inflation rate of Bitcoin will drop to half gold's, overtaking gold as the best store of value in the world. A big turning point.

!!comment!!: A day without blood is like a day without sunshine.
!!comment!!: Biggest mistake you have made in crypto? Selling Bitcoin at 3k has to be mine 😅

A lot of stuff being regurgitated that is fairly common knowledge around here.

When BTC  is at $25K, people want to buy at $22K.

When BTC  is at $22K, people want to buy at $19K.

When BTC  is at $19K, people want to buy at $12K.

And always, when it's at the lows, the fear is the highest, you feel unsafe.

Be different.

!!comment!!: Before Artificial Intelligence should we expect Artificial Dumbness? Imagine an "AI" with an extreme Dunning-Kruger complex, who mistakenly thinks they are super intelligent, who wont listen to reason and who accelerates the end of humanity by making wrong conclusions from information at hand.

Couple that with the Roko's basilisk thought experiment which  states that an otherwise benevolent artificial superintelligence in the future would be incentivized to create a virtual reality simulation to torture anyone who knew of its potential existence but did not directly contribute to its advancement or development. Sounds grim.

Anyway, how is everyone's morning?
!!comment!!: I just started to live alone in the beginning of the month, finally at 34y. Had to move from country though. But with higher salary comes more satoshis. I know why i'm beating my ass of. Hope the future me appreciate the effort! Good weekend y'all!

!!comment!!: I wish my debt ceiling was as flexible as US government 's.

!!comment!!: These charts are no fun if you're sober. I need a few more beers...
!!comment!!: I’m trying to expand my portfolio always in all ways
!!comment!!: I'll be selling an inherited apartment and my thought is "I want to put some into stocks to diversify but that seems riskier than just put it in Bitcoin", in EU I can't invest in S&P directly and nor faang stocks or mid caps seem convincing, they all still seem to be inflated by covid.

!!comment!!: My prediction for next month:  
Shitposting: 📈  
Moon distribution: 📉
!!comment!!: This distribution would have taken us like half a year in the bull market
!!comment!!: Congrats whoever shitposted this month , and double-congrats those who shitposted mostly seating on the toilet 🚽
!!comment!!: So it turns out shitposting is the most profitable thing I do... I would quit my job right now if I had one!
!!comment!!: If 1 more person asks about the ‘moon ratio’ I am going to lose my mind.

READ THE DAMN POST
!!comment!!: Max karma earners brought home $1828 worth of moons this month 👀Not a bad wage for shit posting and chopping it up about crypto!

Edit: my mistake, the ratio was much higher, max karma was worth about $3650 😳
!!comment!!: Do any of you guys have more of them shitcoins?
!!comment!!: I can't believe that ratio, thank you so much for the surprise, Reddit!!
!!comment!!: The ratio today made me happy, moons always make me happy
!!comment!!: I should have shitposted way more :(
!!comment!!: I had a shit day, markets were bad, but that lovely ratio just wiped all my sadness ❤
!!comment!!: Did i really just make $60 this month just by shitposting?
!!comment!!: Got 11.98 moons….so long suckers. I’m quitting my job now and going to be living lavishly.

Alright please dont laugh at me if this might be a simple thing, but is there a wallet that could store MOONs? And are those that i can buy for example at Mexc legit?
Im new at this so any nice suggestions are welcome:)

!!comment!!: Uhh got about 400 moons this time around. The data said I had 198 karma. I mean I’ll take it!
!!comment!!: Btc wants to go up. Stock market is reacting negatively to the fomc minutes from the last meeting and Btc is still up since then. Support seems to be holding… so far

Ok feel a bit better now!
!!comment!!: Glad to see BTC combating to break 24k line, instead of 25k 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️

!!comment!!: Happy Tuesday from Vietnam brothers!!! Hope tomorrow it will pump
!!comment!!: Hey guys, I feel like I should know this, but I don’t and could use a little help.    Is there a way to mix btc that is legal and kyc compliant?   Just to hide wallet info from your recipient?
!!comment!!: Someone is accumulating right now
!!comment!!: Well I asked for volatility and I got volatility.

I regret asking
!!comment!!: Why can't we have nice things!?

Life's great so far. Hope everyone else is doing fine as well!
!!comment!!: I buy crypto = crypto goes down

Simply invest whenever I am not. Stonks.
!!comment!!: [deleted]

!!comment!!: Another miserable day at the fiat mine..
!!comment!!: Woho  didnt expect to get that much Moons. Thank you Mr. Moon

!!comment!!: Top karma earner has received 20k moons this round
!!comment!!: So quite a while back the screen on my phone broke, ended up buying a new phone.

I had a few hundred moons. Thought ok no problem. I can get back in to my Vault. Somehow, no idea how, the seed phrase never worked.

Had to create a new one. There's nothing I can do about it I guess.

If the screen was repaired, and I were to log in to Reddit. Would it be tied to the same Vault?
!!comment!!: That moon ratio is insane. Really regret not commenting more
!!comment!!: Who else feels like if this is the bear market , we’re going to be legend?

Again, congrats everyone on the sweet ratio ♥️
!!comment!!: Wow my portfolio has quickly recovered!💪 let’s get it
!!comment!!: Good morning. Dont mind the red. Will be green soon!
!!comment!!: Not sure if I have upset someone but I can see a heap of my comments have been ⬇️ where others in the threads haven’t. I don’t see a reason but hey it’s probably a good sign for me to sign out for a while. 

Has been crap stuck home for weeks on end with a leg fracture but I can put weight on it as of yesterday - so should probably be doing something more productive with my time anyway. 

May the charts be ever in your favour 💚
!!comment!!: Good morning, it's been a honour losing money with you all overnight

!!comment!!: I feel sorry for everyone that hasn’t discovered crypto yet. It must suck to get a full nights rest.
!!comment!!: I think ETH will grow faster in the next bull market than BTC.

Stuff like the Base announcement today can act as big force multipliers for ETH, plus the constant burning of supply.

I think BTC will always be the dominant crypto, but I think ETH will 2X or 3X much faster than BTC from here.

!!comment!!: Ankr partnered with Microsoft holly shit
!!comment!!: Can’t wait to tell my grandchildren about the 17 great depressions, according to the sub, I lived through.
!!comment!!: After a couple of years in crypto I still don’t know what is going on.
!!comment!!: “Hong Kong going to be a Crypto hub “ News 

Guys this should be a HUGE bullish news , personally becoming months will be incredibly bullish
!!comment!!: What should I do this evening. Stare at boring charts that don't move, or play Hogwart's Legacy?
!!comment!!: Hopefully my moon count will not be zero tomorrow 🤣
!!comment!!: I know we joke about it, but at this point in the cycle nobody should really be selling your positions. Been around a long time, and this year and the next you should really just be building your stack at this point. 

We will very very VERY likely have a big correction at some point and go much lower than we are today, because thats just how things usually work; but it wont matter in the end. As long as you keep adding to your positions via DCA over 23 and 24, you will be fine when the core of the next bull market takes off. (I suspect it will be later than we expect, we will see, but Im not expecting it to just rocket off right at the halving this time).
!!comment!!: Damnit! At this point it feels like we are a kid at the beach slowly building a sand castle, only to have a random teenager kick it down every time.
!!comment!!: One year ago was a very busy day here, with people capitulating at 33 with the first russian bombs only to see a rally to 45. Other bear rally filled by fomo and rocket emojis.

Well, everyone who paper handled was able to buy at half of the price few months later. Moral? None.
!!comment!!: More bad news out of Russia, markets won't take this news well :(
!!comment!!: Shall we have another try at it before stock markets open?
!!comment!!: I can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent
!!comment!!: wow moons are popping off, swear to god they never fail to make me happy
!!comment!!: Thank you reddit you made my anxiety touch the roof today 🤒
!!comment!!: I got bored and with all the talk of the bear bear being over, I was curious about how close some tokens were to their ATH.  So I made a spreadsheet.

!!comment!!: Major headache, sore throat, I feel like shit. Please tell me we’re above 25k, anon
!!comment!!: China says bull run back on!
!!comment!!: China is trying to make Hong Kong a huge crypto hub and just injected near 100 billion into the economy.

Time for all [the "China coins" to take off](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fpb3c90X0AMjOXx?format=jpg&name=large). Some of them already did so, like Neo and FIL.
!!comment!!: ETH will one day have a $1T market cap and then hodling will have paid off tremendously
!!comment!!: Something big is coming up I can sense it
!!comment!!: 10 hours of climbing erased in 5 minutes. 25.250 must’ve really hurt bitcoin.

!!comment!!: Babe wake up, new banner just dropped
!!comment!!: Moons down 12% within 30 mins
!!comment!!: Finally I can see comments again. It’s been a long 25 minutes
!!comment!!: Don't ya love it when your favorite s***coin is such a low cap it doesn't trade along with BTC. Everything else dumps with it. But your tiny s***coin doesn't budge.  Just watches them dump.
!!comment!!: Thank you!! I was on hiatus during the first two Gens, here's hoping!
!!comment!!: Genuinely what do you think you could achieve if you spent as much time dedicated to it as you do watching charts and shitposting on Reddit?

I know I could get in much better shape if I spent this much time running and lifting
!!comment!!: It feels good going to sleep in Europe when you know tomorrow is a moon distribution. Feels almost better than a pay day for some reason.
!!comment!!: I legitimately have not looked at my portfolio value in over a year now. I’ve been auto-buying $10 of BTC every day to average down, but I actually have no idea how much I have right now in that + other crypto and stocks. Once the bull run kicks off I’m gonna take a peak and treat it like a Christmas gift lmao
!!comment!!: When I first made my large research post on matic for this sub she was trading at 29 cents, at the beginning of the bull market. Peaked at 10x that, made my first big bag of profit with matic so it will always hold a place near and dear to my heart. Of course I lost all my profits on other coins but still.
!!comment!!: Currently my portfolio is 70% ETH and 30% BTC. For my DCA going forward should I just go with BTC till I get closer to 50/50?
!!comment!!: Does Coinbase log you out every month or something or it just happens to me?
!!comment!!: I can't even recall the last time I saw anyone mention ANKR since 2021

Grats to anyone that actually had it in their bag!
!!comment!!: Did Reddit stop working for anyone else or was that just me?
!!comment!!: This sub is wild. You get a post that is super informative from an OG in the space. News articles from the premier sources on crypto. And copypasta/low effort content from crayon eaters.   


Your entire perception of crypto could vary depending on the time of day you visit
!!comment!!: I liked every post in here. It took me about two hours. My heart is racing and my thumb is aching. Still worth it.
!!comment!!: Everyone wants Lambo but what if I just want a Suzuki Vitara with plenty of space for my beloved doggo ?
!!comment!!: Jeez quite a scary place being moonless smh
!!comment!!: Why both my portfolio and gf are red at the same time?

Bearish on my mental health
!!comment!!: 25s a bitch the amount of shorts lined up from 23.5 to 25.5 seems too get us every time, today the mcap hit 1.16 t about the time it hit 25 but couldn't hold it.Whats the magic number gonna be another 3 billion maybe too overcome all the shorts.

Bitcoin’s dominance is currently 42.56%, an increase of 0.30% over the day.
!!comment!!: You should invest in crypto

NFA
!!comment!!: Got a notification from the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) app that BTC reached 25k an hour or so ago and got really excited.Maybe today will be the day that it doesn't just brush 25k but it will stay
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: Crypto is so weird like it can just pump randomly then crab for ages then drop then crab for ages then pump massively and crab again. I love the volatility but it doesn't feel like it actually makes much sense
!!comment!!: CRO just pumped 15% in what, 2 hours? Im holding some but still very weird to see a sudden pump like that.
!!comment!!: Goodnight everyone. May the random shit coin you decided to buy pump 80% in the next 24 hours🙏
!!comment!!: China knew Bull Market is on the way so they gonna lift ban to HongKong. China is entering in this game.
!!comment!!: lets hope it holds this time
!!comment!!: Sell volume continuing to fall each time range high is retested

Edit: for transparency I shorted the range high again but I'm not expecting it to pull back as far as yesterday this time. Stop loss at 25.3k, will drop it to entry point soon.
!!comment!!: That 25k really playing hard to get
!!comment!!: C'mon old man BTC. You got this.
!!comment!!: Only the floor is the limit.
!!comment!!: $25k has been rejected almost as many times as I have on Tinder.
!!comment!!: Cmon meme triangle don't let me down. Scalp short closed for a quick $500 move down, that's 3/3 from the range high so going to quit while I'm ahead!

!!comment!!: Finally got my Ledger. Now I can store my coins and help myself avoid stupid trading moves and losing money.
!!comment!!: All I want is to just never work again and spend my days chilling on a boat in the sun, is that really too much to ask?
!!comment!!: According to Bloomberg, China is willing to support Hong Kong's plans to become a cryptocurrency Hub, no wonder why most of Chinese coins are flying 🚀
!!comment!!: Anyone having issues with Coinbase atm? Account balances and asset prices not updating?
!!comment!!: lmao the co founder of 1inch has lost 30 eth to bots while providing liquidity to Uniswap. He settled the slippage at 30% 🤣
!!comment!!: We went up, then we went down, now we crab. I hope we go up again soon
!!comment!!: today is my first day of DCA’ing! and don’t think it was a good day to pick to start lol
!!comment!!: I hope BTC shows some strength in the US stocks session, if we managed to get decoupled we will surely break this 25k cursed area for good 🚀🚀
!!comment!!: I'm feeling good about today guys. Trust me - I'm never wrong.
!!comment!!: Forever bullish on crypto and my Mom's cooking
!!comment!!: You guys think moons will drop in price right after distribution ? Will people sell ? Anyone know what usually happens that time of the month with the prices ?

!!comment!!: Somehow this price action feels manipulated... I might be in the disbelief phase though
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|XKL1MHvk47OXC)
!!comment!!: BTC fees in last 24 hours = 32.7 BTC.

ETH fees = 4251 ETH = ~ 293 BTC

And ironically, which chain is it that is really dependent on fees for security?

Oh and in ETH, these fees get burnt permanently from the supply. That's how eth has developed a trend of negative inflation off late. This is true power of 'usage' rather than 'Walmart uses Vechain' type memes.
!!comment!!: Down only 10% all time on BTC after today, and we aren’t even in a full bull market. DCA and pray
!!comment!!: https://configurator.lamborghini.com/
!!comment!!: BTC, in a Netflix documentary in 10 years time, titled "the last Bullrun": "You know,  I was sitting there, people talking about eth, matic. Moons! Running around, putting up those 20% gains. People talking. I tell you what. People forget. And you know.... I took that personally. "
!!comment!!: Be careful with your Reddit accounts and vaults

!!comment!!: going to sleep. I expect you guys will guide us past 25k by the time I wake up
!!comment!!: I love this time of night when everyone is saying good morning and all the Aussies are saying goodnight. And on that note - goodnight from Sydney. It’s been a pretty awesome day. Especially the promising news from Celsius and the exchange that punched massive holes in my portfolio. Things are looking up 💚💚
!!comment!!: Just shorters at 25k, they will be eaten soon
!!comment!!: If I told you eth would be back at 1720 a month ago y’all would have laughed me off
!!comment!!: Why am I in the green:
1. Made a plan and killed my emotions with DCA
2. Self Custody

It’s the simplest way to do this shit.
!!comment!!: What happened to FTX? Wrong answers only.
!!comment!!: Nice pump today with BTC leading the way. If we keep it up the fomo folks will be joining us shortly. Hope your bags are ready

!!comment!!: anyone know why ckb paampin ?
!!comment!!: I got an early access to Fidelity Crypto. They only have and custody BTC and ETH. I have no reason to use it yet, but if they eventually have the ability to put crypto in a ROTH IRA with no tax on withdrawal that would be a game changer.
!!comment!!: Stop reloading Coingecko please. I want to check my portfolio and you're crashing the fucking thing.

!!comment!!: Let’s see, in the past 2 months Binance…

 1)Suspended all USD deposits and withdrawals after regulatory cracktown

 2)Been implicated in a DOJ takedown of a huge money laundering operation

 3)Their main US banks are both under federal investigation for fraud, and that’s after they suffered multi billion dollar bank-runs

 4)Their stablecoin has been suspended by the NY DFS from issuing new mints after it was uncovered they bullshitted the reserves … and now CZ claims they have no connection 

 5)Their BUSD stablecoin issuer has also been sued by the SEC and issued a Wells notice for dealing in unregistered securities. BUSD is 1/3rd of all binance trade volume 

And people are still defending them while screaming everything is FUD. At this point, everyone deserves what’s coming

!!comment!!: Can’t believe there are people defending ICP. What a joke
!!comment!!: My daughter turned 1 today….damn it’s been a crazy/good year. Here’s to hoping crypto brightens the future for her and all you internet friends 🍻
!!comment!!: On behalf of Dot’s rising perfomance, a slice of cake to everyone! 🍰 🍰 🍰
!!comment!!: I have to wait on dca for this month, I'm buying an engagement ring and chic fil a today. Next month and then on forward is strait btc and eth
!!comment!!: So are moons going to dip when the distribution happens or are we staying above $.20?
!!comment!!: Good Morning,  it's a breezy day today, making some black coffee while watching charts.

Oh btw our moonies are below 20c again :(
!!comment!!: This all feels so uncomfortable lol the gains that is. Feels too good to be true.
!!comment!!: Let’s keep this green going. Daughter is getting her drivers license soon. Terrifying.
!!comment!!: BTC $30k this weekend. I saw it with my superpowers I bought online last week
!!comment!!: Coinbase… I’d like my 4% in XLM back please.
!!comment!!: Hindsight is such a MF with crypto
!!comment!!: A quick reminder before im going to bed, withdraw your coins from exchanges lads.
!!comment!!: whats ur opinion on buying BTC from Fidelity?
!!comment!!: CAKE and XRP are crabbing at the same level for a while. Should I sell it now or hodl ?
!!comment!!: Im just excited for someone to post that train smashing through the 25k GIF
!!comment!!: I just want LTC to stay above 100$
!!comment!!: Make an AI trade bot that does the opposite of what this sub recommends.
!!comment!!: $1700 Eth wow

Great way to start your weekend
!!comment!!: Shall i convert matic to ethereum? Or selling?
!!comment!!: What’s everyone’s thoughts on DOT?
!!comment!!: Good morning boys, charts are looking good
!!comment!!: *sigh* I'm not cut out for day trading HODL life it is homies.
!!comment!!: Good morning everybody! The weekend is here. Now I can drink and watch the charts
!!comment!!: Ok have been out all day and am a few gins down. Shill me something new and interesting to chuck a few $$$ at
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Guess I’ll get up and start HW. 

Two more weeks of corporate finance, then 8 weeks of business law… 

Almost there folks.

And by studying, I mean read a bit and then check the daily about 30 different times…
!!comment!!: It's looking like theres going to be a big pump this weekend
!!comment!!: Anyone know when distribution is?
!!comment!!: To whom can I reach out if I have a new idea for Moon that could be tested in next month's polls?
!!comment!!: Why don’t all subs adopt moons? Is there a lot of admin required?

!!comment!!: This has gone on long enough. Ready the 25k battering ram.
!!comment!!: This sub is seriously delusional with the way everyone keeps harping on about owning Lamborghinis. 

There are maybe 6 million users here and only about 40,000 Lamborghinis available worldwide. It's impossible. We will need to branch out and look other options like Ferrari, Rolls Royce, Porsche, even Bentleys. We can't ALL buy Lamborghinis. Grow up guys.
!!comment!!: The best thing about crypto for me is it has made me more financially aware. The amount of shit I used to waste money on and not think was ridiculous.

I've made money since I got into crypto but I've made far more by changing spending habits.
!!comment!!: Imagine going out on a Saturday night instead of sitting home alone shit posting about crypto and farming moons.
!!comment!!: VET only -89% down from ATH. Lets fucking go
!!comment!!: Let the party begin, see if we hold 25k this time around.
!!comment!!: BTC is still at a great accumulation price.
!!comment!!: Anyone buying the moons dip?
!!comment!!: A Vechain pump has appeared, one of the rarest occurrences.
!!comment!!: VET is pumping slightly, that can only mean BTC will dump soon
!!comment!!: Unrelated to crypto but I just feel the need to get it off my chest. 

Just been into a public toilet and got followed in by a few guys who I’m presuming were on drugs and were going in there to take more. Came in screaming, kicking the doors and generally being dickheads. Then I came out from the quickest piss of my life and they start shouting abuse at me, felt like they wanted a fight tbh. Like wtf is wrong with some people?

On the one hand I wanted to say something back to them but on the other I didn’t fancy fighting 3/4 druggies who probably carry knives (UK) I’m definitely no Tyson fury either lol

Then on the way out some poor old guy is going in and I gave him a heads up, he went in anyway. I sure hope he is okay. 

I fucking pray crypto gives me enough money to move to a remote place and avoid this kind of shit
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: I shorted so it goes up. Im taking one for the team
!!comment!!: A wild VET appeared. It used PUMP
!!comment!!: If history repeats itself, we are in the “2019” part of the cycle. We’ll have ups and downs but the bottom is in. Happy accumulating.
!!comment!!: stop it, i can only get so VET
!!comment!!: Its finally happening guys. VET is getting listed on Thursday!!!
!!comment!!: Anybody else holding back on buying more as the prices go up? I've only been in the game a little over a year. So I'm used to prices going down. It seems counterintuitive to buy when they're on an upward trend. But I'm not sure if that's just because I've never experienced a bull market.
!!comment!!: Fun fact guys do you know Vitalik Buterin was just 19 years old when he wrote the ETH whitepaper.
!!comment!!: i have to be ready to go to work 5 hours later but i can't sleep. Still thinking about the color of my Lambo

!!comment!!: This shit is more exciting than the Battle of Winterfell
!!comment!!: Is BTC at 75k and ETH at 7.5k during the next bull run realistic?
!!comment!!: 1 hour ago we were at 25k, I come back from watching Disney+ and it's gone, what have you guys done? 😭
!!comment!!: Should I short it so it goes up? 🤔
!!comment!!: Bitcoin seems to have bumped it’s head on the ceiling again
!!comment!!: Wish I had just done the very annoying KYC in 2020 and would have bought ETH at $80. I hate my past lazy self
!!comment!!: You said throw your whole tax return into crypto??
!!comment!!: If we rip through 25k on a sunday evening daaamn
!!comment!!: Bruh I'm up 25% for the whole year and only 4.3% down overall. I started in Nov 21 bought everything at ATH's, I DCA and accumulated cash back in crypto all last year, surreal to see it pay off. Next bull run is all GREEN for me.
!!comment!!: Big test right here. Get past 25.3k!!! Come on BTC!!
!!comment!!: Passing 25 k again, keep pushing harder BTC! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
!!comment!!: Can someone explain how these huge crypto wide dips happen? Like is it just some whale dumping their coins?

I’m really dumb, so would appreciate layman answers.
!!comment!!: So Yahoo just emailed me congratulations on my 14 year anniversary of having the same email address. Jesus man. 14 years. Hodl game strong on the email addy.
!!comment!!: i keep looking and checking my portfolio in every five minutes. It's totally fine right?
!!comment!!: i promise it won't be a bloody Sunday

!!comment!!: The daily’s been blowing up recently!!!
!!comment!!: Signing out from the US, y’all keep things crabby for me til next time okay?
!!comment!!: The next btc halving is just next year, I remember it being 2020 like yesterday...
!!comment!!: What does the cc next to our names mean again? Sorry, I don’t post like I used to and forgot.
!!comment!!: Damn I’m so happy I reached my goal ! 
Didn’t check my portfolio for 7 hours straight, NOT EVEN ONCE .
!!comment!!: Good morning guys❤️. Wishing a lovely day to you all. Market is still struggling. Which means its open for all possibilities.
!!comment!!: BULLS ASSEMBLE !!! Let’s blast thru this 25k
!!comment!!: If BTC goes to 25k, i’m having hot dinner tonight
!!comment!!: Once we smash 25k is going to be bye bye see you at 30K. Mark my sword
!!comment!!: We ready for a bounce over $25k?!

![gif](giphy|2hl086Ui4W4YU)
!!comment!!: When we finally manage to stay above 25k without getting immediately slapped back, what's next? Elevator up to the 30th floor?
!!comment!!: dot reacted very well these two days.
!!comment!!: If we close past 25k I'm going to make very reasonable financial decisions.
!!comment!!: Get rekt shorts !!!! Hahahaha
!!comment!!: I don't get all these people claiming this pump is fake because it's allegedly people dumping their BUSD for BTC. I mean, who GAF what the reason for the pump is? Price is still going up, shorts are getting rekt, and bears are looking like numpties.
!!comment!!: I guess it's a party than!
!!comment!!: LET´S FUCKING HOLD THE 25K!!
!!comment!!: I love how all YouTube TA's are all the same. "I think price will go up....but it can also go down" and vice versa
!!comment!!: I wish my marriage was as strong as this 25k resistance

!!comment!!: İm buying the shit out now. Lets goo
!!comment!!: if it goes up we are making money ;
if goes down DCA and relax
!!comment!!: Crypto fact: the first cryptocurrency ever created was called eCash which was created by a company called DigiCash in the year 1990
!!comment!!: I'm tired of being rejected by 25k. Was it my breathe?
!!comment!!: Apparently it's cow tipping Monday tomorrow
!!comment!!: Wtf am I doing with my life?

Oh, hi Mark.
!!comment!!: I haven't seen any crypto ads on the Daytona NASCARs.....is anyone paying attention though?? I see a big oblong balloon over the stadium...!!
!!comment!!: The most funny thing I heard today. Is about mark lol. He noticed that people are really obsessed with their social media’s accounts… so he tried to suggest same services as elon musk did with twitter’s accounts. Wyt guys!? Would you pay for that !?
!!comment!!: Good evening! How is everyone feeling today?
!!comment!!: Alright folks that's enough for me tonight, but that charts aren't gonna watch themselves so if someone could keep an eye on them for me I'd appreciate it
!!comment!!: Lazy Sunday is gone... Let's sleep and go back to the fiat mine on busy Monday.
!!comment!!: Hello thread

Goodbye thread
!!comment!!: I’m currently living in my car so I can DCA big time for the rest of the year. Ask me anything.
!!comment!!: Let's go!

!!comment!!: goodnight fellow degens ! sleep well dream about more green !
!!comment!!: So... are nice low Matic fees "the good old days" now? I didn't anticipate this.
!!comment!!: I'm still expecting a big drop this year before the bull run.

I'm DCAing but if we hit all time lows I think I'm going to ape in.
!!comment!!: MATIC to jump ADA by the end of the day?
!!comment!!: Another Sunday another crab day, I hope there will be  more good news next week
!!comment!!: Polkadot layeth the smack down!
!!comment!!: Every day you get tipped moons is a good day - I will return the favor at some point. Love you all
!!comment!!: Dot is doing good, up 5.4%. Good to see
!!comment!!: I'm at that age where glasses is needed... I get my glasses in a few days, soon I can follow the charts even more closely 📈 see my losses more clearly will also be a side effect...
!!comment!!: I’m so glad I got a bag of VET when it tanked :D
!!comment!!: I overhauled my portfolio recently, cut some dead weight and rebalanced. It’s now less volatile and happier! BTC, ETH, Matic.
!!comment!!: Sunday's goal: don't look at the 1s charts  
  
Update: failed
!!comment!!: That's some really powerful crab we are getting this weekend. Relentlessly going right!
!!comment!!: Let’s hope we can get above 25k and chill there for a bit before blasting off again! 🚀🚀

!!comment!!: Let's a play a game. Use the daily to figure out what price btc is.
!!comment!!: Sunday pump was not on my bingo card
!!comment!!: 25k again!  It'll stay above 25k this time, right?  Right?

!!comment!!: Anyone know where I can custom design a suit with a bunch of moon logos on it? I want to go to some meetings and conferences... lol
!!comment!!: There's no real way to stop staking on a decentralized, permissionless Dex. Unless the SEC gets the people running the front ends for those Dexes to agree to block use of their websites for US IP addresses (in which case US residents just use a VPN).

CEXes are another story. They've always been the weak point for crypto. They're where you turn fiat into crypto and crypto back into fiat in your bank account. We don't like them, but we need them if we're ever going to make money selling. And we need them every time we want to buy more using our fiat. And the CEXes will jump through whatever government hoops needed to stay in business,

!!comment!!: Ok crypto fam, i guess its time to buy the dip again
!!comment!!: I see Craig Wright has been denied his (imaginary) story by a judge, again. 

You know, Craig, you can easily prove you are Satoshi by moving some of Satoshi’s coins in a transaction you announced beforehand. 

But you can’t do that, can you Craig? Because you aren’t Satishi, are you Craig? Can you fuck off now, Craig?
!!comment!!: Finally got my nano s plus. Not your keys not your crypto
!!comment!!: Is this Kraken news real or fud

They are stopping all staking 

https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1623767312116449281?t=iJlRqYuen6msfgKGRecjhQ&s=19
!!comment!!: Fingers crossed the SEC announcement will just be another Bitzlato-level statement.
!!comment!!: Kraken will automatically unstake all U.S. client assets enrolled in the on-chain staking program. These assets will no longer earn staking rewards. This applies to all staked assets except for staked ether (ETH), which will be unstaked after the Shanghai upgrade. U.S. clients will not be able to stake any additional assets, including ETH.

Kraken will continue to offer staking services for non-U.S. clients through a separate Kraken subsidiary.
!!comment!!: Me, a European: staking untouched and the price dips? Fuck yeah, loading up.
!!comment!!: I'm glad that the SEC is protecting me from Kraken while doing nothing to get my money back from Celsius or Blockfi.
!!comment!!: the sec is fucking the market even harder than inflation. good job protectors.
!!comment!!: Couple of days ago: I wish for another buying opportunity at lower prices

Now: Oh shit what is happening?
!!comment!!: Who cares, keep up with the monthly buys and reap the insane profits in a year or so! Easy money, this game is just too damn easy.
!!comment!!: It must’ve been green, but it’s over now.
!!comment!!: Remember the before times?

Like an hour ago?
!!comment!!: Looool crypto is so dumb and I’m dumb for enjoying this shit, what even happened this time
!!comment!!: Pump hard, dump hard baby.
!!comment!!: I chose a great time to buy Arbitrum pump and dump coins (yesterday) :(
!!comment!!: Close the chart and ride it out.
!!comment!!: What if the US government is secretly run by vampires and that's why they want to ban staking? /s
!!comment!!: SEC announcement was a joke, no need for staking(lending) on CEX.

Does this mean people won’t be able to short crypto anymore?
!!comment!!: People panic over the dumbest shit. This market is weird.
!!comment!!: It appears the dip I bought before was in fact NOT the dip.
!!comment!!: Inflates away your money so you’re forced into risk assets.

Destroys the value of your risk assets with nonstop regulations against good exchanges and let bad exchanges go unchecked.

Lol so how are we supposed to make money?
!!comment!!: ‘You will own nothing and be happy’ - Governments
!!comment!!: Finally the accumulation gods have listened. Use this as an opportunity to buy at a discount. The world hasn't ended, just a minor pit on the road.
!!comment!!: Thanks to the peeps who talked me out of fomoing into GRT yesterday. CC advice isn't always terrible.
!!comment!!: SEC: We did it! We saved US customers from gaining yield on their assets!
!!comment!!: 2 years ago today, Tesla bought $1.5 billion of BTC. Were you guys around at that time, I think at the time of the announcement there was a 5k green candle. Safe to say the crypto world went nuts.
!!comment!!: Maybe no Super Bowl ads will somehow spark the market…
!!comment!!: Been playing so much Hogwarts legacy I haven't checked my portfolio all day, wtf happened?
!!comment!!: I was just going to buy more anyway. Might as well be cheap. 🤷🏽‍♂️

What are you going to do?
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: BREAKING: SEC doesn’t understand staking.
!!comment!!: Fuck it I just caught the knife
!!comment!!: Feels like a lot of calculated fud articles these days with horrible click bait to try and tank this crypto rally.
!!comment!!: Important to note: Currently this will only effect US Kraken customers
!!comment!!: Does anyone else think the staking news is not as bad as we feared? 

It’s not an outright ban on staking but rather exchange staking - with the difference being that the SEC is not saying you can’t stake your crypto, as you can still do so natively on blockchains or DEXs etc, just not with exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. 

The SEC is probably just trying to prevent another FTX, Celsius, Voyager, the list goes on and on, from happening. I just hope there isn’t any regulatory creep with it.
!!comment!!: Because I've seen it posted wrong already a hundred times today:

The SEC did not ban staking. Kraken and the SEC reached a settlement that resulted in Kraken permanently removing their staking program in the US. 

This does not mean staking was banned. Kraken is now banned from staking in the US. That's all we know. They man be coming for Coinbase next, or trying to set a precedent with smaller exchanges first, but that's all speculation still. Maybe Kraken had some less than savvy things going on with their program? Yet again, speculation. 

Stick to the facts. Too many people spreading FUD already.
!!comment!!: The SEC is the ultimate shit coin
!!comment!!: Market dipping on my day DCA schedule? Don't mind if I do.
!!comment!!: I finally set up my vault after looking from the sidelines for a while now. I feel accomplished
!!comment!!: It always amazes me how fast the mentality changes here in the sub. 

From bullish to crabby to bearish in a matter of hours.
!!comment!!: You guys are overreacting. I've been reading you for a while before checking prices and I thought the crash was much bigger than this. We're at 22.5k for god's sake. We were at 16k not even a month ago. Relax.

!!comment!!: What was the catalyst for this downtrend today?
!!comment!!: Y'all think the dip's over?  Or more coming?
!!comment!!: I’m curious, we always hear about bitcoin maxis but are there any alt coin maxis. Do you only buy one specific alt coin like Eth, Ada, matic, etc?
!!comment!!: Almost done importing all of my crypto into Koinly (for U.S. tax purposes). And I'd just like to say that binance.us is a shit show. KuCoin? No problem. Coinbase? No problem. Most wallets? No problem. But [binance.us](https://binance.us)? Absolute shit show. Nothing is even remotely close to correct. CSV file? Off by a mile. API? Off by 2 miles. I don't know what to do. [binance.US](https://binance.US) was my primary exchange all year, so tons of transactions. I'm going to set my hair on fire..
!!comment!!: Looks like uncertainty is back on the menu looking at the stock market. Not a big surprise consider how the FED basically told the bulls to fuck off with their unexpected rate hike plan.

Wasn’t surprising tbh a 6%+ rates makes way more sense to fight back a 6-8% inflation. Better to get it done safely before a double inflation cycle crashes the markets like 2008. 

Wouldn’t surprise me to see the markets just shake around in a 20-30% price range through the year with whales milking retail on SEC news and others
!!comment!!: Friendly reminder that staking made up 11% of Coinbase revenue in Q3.
!!comment!!: Bitcoin losing strength here, below the 8EMA (yellow line) is a sign of weakness as it was bouncing off it throughout the uptrend. Still within the range at the moment but it ain't looking good bruv

!!comment!!: Eh fuck this I'm going back to sleep.
!!comment!!: Fun fact: Bitcoin has hit the CVDD floor 4 times in its history and the last time was about 3 months ago. Every time it has hit the CVDD floor a new all time high was made before hitting the CVDD floor again.

More info:

CVDD (Cumulative Value Days Destroyed) has historically picked the bottom of the market. It works off the theory that when significantly old coins (say bought at $10) pass to new investors (say at $10,000), the market perceives a higher floor.
!!comment!!: Why does it say bronze and cc:21 under my username?
!!comment!!: Will there ever be a day when Coinbase just works?

!!comment!!: Wallet questions - 

I don’t own a pc, and I don’t have enough invested to even invest in a cold wallet. So I’m looking at trust and metamask. But, I want it to store btc, ETH and SHIB. Do I need multiple wallets? 

Does each type of coin get stored in its own wallet with its own seed phrase? 

I’m reading that they’re compatible with Binance and coinbase. What if you have coins on crypto.com? What do you do then?

The whole process makes me nervous tbh bc I’m so flighty. Trying to do it in the most fail proof, eili5, crypto for dummies way.

I’m DYOR’ing right now but these are the questions that I’m just struggling with.
!!comment!!: Guys, don’t be disappointed but I traded some moons for an avatar. Magic internet points for jpeg. Doesn’t get any more degenerate than that.

!!comment!!: ROSE and HBAR balancing the rest of my crabbing portfolio after the SEC Kraken news.
!!comment!!: I don’t know who needs to hear this, but using smart contracts to stake is not custodial. 

Smart contracts are by definition automated code. They have defined inputs and defined outputs; if this, then that.

Being ‘locked’ in a smart contract doesn’t mean you do not have custody. All coins are still cryptographically owned by you and your wallet.

Custody refers to giving someone else the legal right or guardianship of your assets. This does not happen with a smart contract.

What are your Coin Couples?

Which coins or tokens do you feel naturally pair well together for whatever reason you have?

!!comment!!: Helium miner rant - lost 3 rigs over the past week

I’ve been mining helium awhile now and decided to invest a lot into building some long range solar-powered rigs to extend my network. I set up some units in Utah in the fall and got a great rural network up and running. Unfortunately, putting the rigs up on “state land” was not a great idea, and they’ve been taken down one by one by some locals who don’t understand the importance of the coming global Internet of Things.


So after all those rigs lost I’m at least 10 years away from profit due to this setback. Anyway. I decided to bring my networks a little higher, somewhere authorities who don’t understand crypto won’t be able to just take down. I figured that you’ve got to spend money to make money. So I bought and launched a few dirigibles and drones to take my helium mining rigs to the skies, where they won’t bother anyone - or so I thought. In the last week alone, 3 of my rigs have been shot down by F-22’s all over the country and in Canada. My network is a wreck. I’m beginning to think that I may never financially recover from this, and now I’m seriously worried my wife is gonna find out.

(*yes this is a joke*)
!!comment!!: Quick, while the Americans are busy with the Super Bowl, lets gossip about them
!!comment!!: I wonder how many people was lured in the zk narrative and now is realising that maybe they bought a local top in LRC, mina, or other and are waiting a miracle or ready to sell low.

Remember kids, don't chase pumps

!!comment!!: Guys do you think the dca day matters?
!!comment!!: OK, Super Bowl is over.  Time for BTC to start its pump to 25K now..
!!comment!!: Alright, take your sports gambling winnings and put them into crypto
!!comment!!: I’ve collected my CDC diamond today, as I do every day from the toilet once I’m awake
!!comment!!: When has SEC ever protected retail investors in crypto or even stocks? Now they are suing paxos for issuing Busd and other stable coins. Where were they when SBF and do kwon was scamming the whole space.
!!comment!!: Feels very doom and gloom today, even more so than when bitcoin was 15k.
!!comment!!: People leaving BUSD like a forest fire.
!!comment!!: Was there any bad crypto news today?
!!comment!!: I thought the SEC was in the business of regulation, instead they seem content to line their pockets with fines while swinging their ban hammer.
!!comment!!: Super excited for the next ETH Shanghai update, anyone else excited?
!!comment!!: Sending smoke signals out to the cryptoverse
!!comment!!: Maybe I’m an anomaly, but I feel like crypto couldn’t be the Wild West forever and sec regulation was only a matter of time. Personally the fact that there’s no real official public tether reserves keeps me from ever owning some. Who’s to say they’re not degenning all your money behind the scenes.

If they have a framework they can operate within and it boots trust and transparency without going too far that’s fine.

!!comment!!: I think my nft is gonna be worthless now haha
!!comment!!: Well I guess my Philly Eagles NFT isn’t going to be worth much.  Good thing I got it for free.
!!comment!!: About to go mine some fiat, have a good day everyone
!!comment!!: Just passed my second financial advisor assessment. I get to keep my job! (For now at least).
!!comment!!: According to CZ tweet:  "BUSD, even though called Binance USD, is NOT issued or redeemed by Binance." I don't know if its safe to be holding busd now.
!!comment!!: Wow, CZ Binance just announced that BUSD is basically dead and they will be seeing people migrate to a new stablecoin because of it.

Heres the tweet storyline: https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1625067484368740353?cxt=HHwWgoCx3YuRs40tAAAA


So Im guessing its going to end up being USDC.
!!comment!!: Maybe things would be different if the crypto community/ industry had stood with XRP when the SEC sued Ripple.
!!comment!!: A bull, a bear and a crab meet in a bar. Nothing happens. End.
!!comment!!: The NEW YORK department of financial services is asking PAXOS to stop issuing Binance’s BUSD.            But in the other hand. Paxos said that all existing BUSD tokens will remain fully supported and redeemable through the Paxos Trust until at least February 2024!!
!!comment!!: Looks like a good day to buy some more eth 😊
!!comment!!: Wow all the red. Makes me sad.
!!comment!!: Stock markets rips and crypto dumps :/ nice
!!comment!!: Strap into your seat boys, it’s going to be a wild ride.
!!comment!!: what i don't get is why BUSD and not USDT?  You would think the SEC would see Tether as a much bigger problem.
!!comment!!: solution:  everyone that has busd, just move that into btc.  

would be fun to see 15b of market cap suddenly added.
!!comment!!: wahaha im out for this dump, enjoy
!!comment!!: I never feel more saved than when my portfolio takes a dive. thanks SEC!
!!comment!!: 60 ppl are in daily, that is good omen
!!comment!!: Guys this is possibly my last day. The SEC deemed me a security

!!comment!!: Okay, just praying to God nanooverbtc does not sell his moons now lol
!!comment!!: Sold 10k moons and converted it to 1 ETH. I may regret it. But what the hell!
!!comment!!: Can I get some green candles for my cake day?
!!comment!!: 20x leverage apto wish me luck
!!comment!!: Had $25 left in my trading account that I didn’t put into anything on my DCA day. Couldn’t figure out what to do with it.

Topped up another $25 and split it between BTC and ETH. Can’t go wrong with those two.
!!comment!!: Link at $24 used to be a deal 😩 what is this new world 😳
!!comment!!: Eventually US gov will say crypto is only used by aliens from moon.
!!comment!!: The coinbase card just reached a new low. Most options are only offering 0.5% back going forward
!!comment!!: People talking about no crypto ads in Super Bowl this year. I guess that no ads are still ads
!!comment!!: Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a crazy victory 🙌
!!comment!!: Two things I never bet on- weekend pumps and the Eagles
!!comment!!: Rant. I’m irritated at the game, and crypto is back down, and I have to go back to work in the morning and probably the state will walk in to survey. I need a puppy to cuddle or something.
!!comment!!: This eagle NFT is worthless to be. Dumb birds
!!comment!!: Happy I got a Chiefs ones now ;D

Anyone buying?

!!comment!!: How is BUSD a Security?  
  
A Security is: (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits (4) earned through the efforts of others.
!!comment!!: If you haven’t installed 2FA yet. I suggest you do.
!!comment!!: If paxos cant mint BUSD, im not sure what will keep BUSD blowing above $1 if traders decide they want to depeg it upwards
!!comment!!: Does anyone know if tomorrows CPI report can be watched live anywhere? Seems i cant find any relevant info source.
!!comment!!: I have 0.00003262 BTC left on localbitcoins, this is lower than their insane withdrawal fee.

They are free to send to another localbitcoins wallet though. If anyone has enough BTC on localbitcoins to withdraw and hasn't done so, I'll glady send you this dust for free. I'd rather give it away then let it sit on their site.
!!comment!!: Seriously do I need to sell my BUSD or is this just a minor reaction to the future of BUSD closing???
!!comment!!: Don't worry. It is only money. There are more important things in life.
!!comment!!: Is there any good resources that explain moons and how they work or is the limited info Reddit gives us it?
!!comment!!: Copped some more FET and AVAX. We drop more then I’ll be increasing position in BTC. Happy investing y’all and don’t listen to people who say wait longer to buy for lower. Take advantage of this red !!!

!!comment!!: lot of people on here talking about GRT

Top must be in
!!comment!!: ROSE f**** flying as expected
!!comment!!: Don't know who is pumping Rose, but keep going. It's 1 of my smallest bag but it broke even.

Damn it feels good to see things braking even again.
!!comment!!: Gonna be a great day when Eth gets past 2k
!!comment!!: Inflation under control. soft landing! Fed pivot! economy looks great. Everything is fine!
!!comment!!: Investing in cryptocurrency means you are postponing from consuming in the present in favor of consuming more in the future.
!!comment!!: There is a certain fractal element about this market.  That is, once every 4 years, you have a big alt run (a.k.a. alt season) but more frequently, you have little alt runs (just like the current one).  Most of these alt runs (little or huge) end badly with a major dumping.  The signature of these runs ending is that Bitcoin starts to stall (like right now), but retailers are so busy with alt  FOMO that they stop paying attention to Bitcoin as they look for the next coin to moon.

I think this is what is happening right now.  Beware as this type of Bitcoin struggling with alts running never ever ends good.
!!comment!!: Do Moons even have chance to be listed on big cex's considering Reddit is currently dont wanna deal with the legal issues that may come up with Moons in the future?
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Just bought more moons using Moonpay to buy ETH onto Arbitrum One, then sushiswapping onto Nova AND THEN swapping for Moons

!!comment!!: What happens to ROSE, just up 28% to $0.074
!!comment!!: NEAR just tweeted about AI and the price jumped. Guess it's the season.
!!comment!!: Who is this Craig wright guy and why does he wanna trademark Bitcoin?
!!comment!!: I posted here 12 months ago about the supply squeeze for moons hitting EXACTLY in February of 2023 where 69% of the overall supply would have already been distributed.  Given the burn rate, and BEFORE these ad projects became known.  This is the month that from here on out, moons will be scarce.  However that was before all of the karma max implementation rules.  Still this is the month and from here on, best of luck grabbing them on the cheap.
!!comment!!: My little bag of FET has grown. Anyone else in on any AI coins?
!!comment!!: I’m still $700 away from breakeven. Cmon crypto keep going please 🙏
!!comment!!: BREAKING NEWS: Reddit has announced Moons will be the official AI coin of Reddit. When asked about what that specifically means, an admin claimed "idk machine learning go brrr". The price of moons is currently skyrocketing like many other AI coins as many claim this will be a paradigm shift in AI computing.
!!comment!!: This is my break even point. Or at least as close as I can estimate until I sit down and do the maths for a years worth of DCA. Not too shabby for the long term imo
!!comment!!: Anyone else glad they stuck it out through all of the bad news and drama and believed in the principles of decentralization and transparency?
!!comment!!: Well that was an expensive vet visit to take away my DCA. Atleast my pup is fine and nothing life threatening

Edit: id sell and give away my whole portfolio for my dog. She’s worth it
!!comment!!: Let's make something clear

There is no material integration between AI and Crypto. 

You cannot put AI 'into a blockchain'.

AI tokens are meme tokens.
!!comment!!: Happy to see moons are doing good
!!comment!!: Friends are temporary. Moons are eternal.
!!comment!!: I definitely didn’t look into new projects enough, didn’t even know these ai coins existed
!!comment!!: Daily reminder don't marry your bags.

!!comment!!: I’ll keep my Eth til it hits 10k… staked and happy.
!!comment!!: Is there a minimum karma requirment to be eligible for moons in a given cycle?
!!comment!!: One of the major exchanges needs to get their shit together and list moons already
!!comment!!: My Rosies doing a lil sum
!!comment!!: Never thought moons would perform that good in a bear market, imagine next bull with a lot of new usecases. What a time to be alive
!!comment!!: It's a little surreal that my modest bag of moons is now worth over 600 Euros,
!!comment!!: Time to sleep. Someone take over checking the charts every 5 minutes
!!comment!!: Cramer said yesterday that we are in a bullmarket. Sell everything
!!comment!!: Looks like a big announcement is coming regarding avatars. Hopefully either gen 3 or a reddit marketplace.

!!comment!!: S&P 500 ain’t having great time
!!comment!!: is DOT the best purchase that can be done today?
!!comment!!: I am commenting in the daily for the first time in a long time. Bullish! 🚀
!!comment!!: Something bad about DOT ? I mean there is a lot going on in programming and it's a 5x to the old ATH. Maybe in the next bullrun it goes even higher. Seems a solid investment or do I miss something ?
!!comment!!: Are you more an active crypto investor or a passive one? Passive: you buy some coins and then not really follow what is happening with what you bought. Active: you follow all or most of your coins and stay up to date with what is going on with them on at least a monthly basis or more often and possibly move your crypto around some and not just have it sit on an exchange.
!!comment!!: Out of curiosity how’s everyone doing this bear market, anyone break even, in profits, still in the red?
!!comment!!: Just got my Super Bowl avatar baby! Go birds 🦅
!!comment!!: A couple moons a day keeps the debt collectors away.
!!comment!!: 16cent moons?

Next thing you know they'll be 69cents

And then $1.00

!!comment!!: How many moons did Gecko burn to get banner? Does anyone know?
!!comment!!: If you had to pick three alts that aren't Ethereum to DCA, what would they be, and what is your split %-wise?
!!comment!!: For the average person whom is likely to live long enough to still be around in 20 years, getting one whole Bitcoin into your bag before the next bullrun, and keeping it that long, may very well trump any other investment you'll ever have the opportunity to make.
!!comment!!: Has the new bull run started???? Omg!  I am greeen I am greeeeeen in 4 out of 27 of my shit coins
!!comment!!: Bitcoin ready to pop. 30k eom?
!!comment!!: Our beloved moons are going to moon
!!comment!!: Imagine that, moons cost more than any popular dog themed shit coins
!!comment!!: Say moons go on a crazy run in the future and you end up being able to swap your bag 1:1 with a full BTC, would you do it? On one hand having the opportunity to jump ship into a full BTC would offer a bit more safety, but if moons go to $10 or something crazy it would be better to hodl… Just a thought I’ve been tinkering with in my head lately.
!!comment!!: Oh my god ROSE. Go you beautiful thing 🌹🌹🌹
!!comment!!: Damn moons seriously pumping right now!!
!!comment!!: There should be a tool that estimates the up to date moon/karma ratio for the current period. Would that be very complicated to produce?

!!comment!!: Was kinda cool to see moons get some exposure: https://blockworks.co/news/reddits-crypto-moons-upvote-a-73-surge-in-2023

Even referenced ccmoons.com, resulting in an all time high number of unique daily visitors
!!comment!!: Posting from a workout bike. New level of shitposting unlocked 🔓
!!comment!!: Just 700% more on GRT and I break even , lets goo
!!comment!!: BTC still outperforming nearly all possible investments YTD.
!!comment!!: Just realised that fetch.ai has done a 10x in 2 months in a bear market ☠️
!!comment!!: I see “Baby doge coin” is ranked #92 on coingecko. With a max supply of 420,000,000,000,000,000, I don’t even know how to pronounce this number lol.
!!comment!!: Goodnight everyone! And to good news tomorrow 🍻
!!comment!!: I just checked my nfts from my reddit vault via trust wallet. I also saw 2 other nfts that were airdropped to me. Now i know it's either a scam or a super scam. 

Can anyone explain how a scam like that works and if I can get rid of these nfts without getting burned?
!!comment!!: Don’t forget your free Reddit Superbowl NFT
!!comment!!: Btc at 23,031 = euphoric

BTC at 22900 = depressed
!!comment!!: I don't know bout y'all, but I'm about ready to take some profits next rally. Nothing too crazy. Enough to pay monthly mortgage? Could be really gratifying. Fingers crossed for this Friday. Market doesn't have to straight up moon, but it's been a LONG time since I ever took anything out of my -60% investment.

I gotta thank [Fetch.ai](https://Fetch.ai) for going bananas over the last couple months; wish I had bought a bigger bag. Shout out to Litecoin and Bitcoin for holding the fort. Gotta give Jasmy a little nudge like "you awake, bro? I've seen your volume lately. It's time to go." 

  
Nonetheless, I hope to have at least a month or so of some dampened financial worries. And by the end of the year, perhaps a new pot of savings to disperse into a Roth and other smart financial moves.

Stay saucy, r/Cryptocurrency
!!comment!!: JPOW: We expect inflation to go down significantly in 2023
!!comment!!: I have been gone for 1 day what the fuck is an AI coin lmao
!!comment!!: Damn, what a shit day (personally speaking). 

Finally managed to get in touch with my family in Turkey. My aunt was badly hurt (broken leg and pelvis) but is in stable condition at the hospital, and everyone else is fine or just has minor cuts and bruises. But their entire home and possessions have been destroyed, as their apartment block/building collapsed during the aftermath. 

Hope everyone else has had a better day though; good to see the daily so active again. Just needed to vent for a bit.
!!comment!!: THIS CYCLE SO FAR: 

1. AI coins pumped to start things off.   Then they cooled down for a few weeks. 

.
2.  Other coins pumped. Metaverse, and layer ones like FTM, INJ, etc.  They cooled off. 

.
3. Meme coins pumped.  They cooled off. 

Now, AI coins are pumping again after their break. They should be about ready for another break about now. 

So........  Next should be layer ones again, since they have cooled off and are ready to rocket.  🚀
!!comment!!: My ETH/BTC/ADA stacks looking like stablecoins.
!!comment!!: Remember when every startup was building metaverse? Now all of them are now building AI 😂
!!comment!!: Went to sleep 23K Bitcoin and woke up 23K Bitcoin.. 

Than again, I just slept for 5 min.
!!comment!!: Powell is dovish af. 

It’s over for the bears. Rip.

!!comment!!: Get yer new avatars: https://www.reddit.com/avatar/claim/nfl_superbowl_2023

￼​
!!comment!!: I'm not sure if it's been shared here already, but for anyone who might care, the new Polygon website features [Reddit avatars](https://beta.polygon.technology/)
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: For the first time I understand people not wanting their coin to pump to quickly. I want to buy more FET but it won’t stop pumping!
!!comment!!: Hummingbirds can fly in all directions - forward, backward, up, down, and sideways. They can even hover in one spot.

Reminds me of the price action of a particular coin
!!comment!!: The 3 AI coins (OCEAN,GRT and FET) I threw money in 24 hours ago are going really really well. Plus the AGIX I bought some days ago seems unstoppable. 
Following random people advice in this sub pays off sometime
!!comment!!: Crypto run on narrative and hype. It's AI coins season and I think I will submit to the narrative and buy Fet or something
!!comment!!: Whatever you guys have been wrong before, I just FOMOD hard into GRT
!!comment!!: Next stop for GRT is $0.5
!!comment!!: Can we please get a moment of silence for everyone’s phone batteries today as we incessantly monitor the charts of our favorite shitcoin?
!!comment!!: * Crypto community already donated 2 million for Turkey in a little over 3 hours @ [https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/APE-JBS8U7](https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/APE-JBS8U7)
* Binance [pledged](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/charity/binance-to-airdrop-$100-usd-1883-try-in-bnb-to-users-in-the-turkey-earthquake-region-8156736968497181390) to airdrop $100 USD in BNB to users in the Turkey earthquake region 
* Lots of other exchanges said they would help both Turkey and Syria 

I love this community. Lets help out those in need.
!!comment!!: Finally getting back into DCAing. 

Gonna go in on the obvious BTC and ETH, but shill me your favourites looking towards the next bull run.

Definitely grabbing some ALGO.
!!comment!!: We going straight to 25k now?
!!comment!!: Things are happening!!! 

Gen 3 soon!!!!
!!comment!!: moons gonna break .15c today?
!!comment!!: GRT been around years, now suddenly AI is the hot thing people are buying it lmfao.
!!comment!!: Damn geckoterminal new banner or whut?
!!comment!!: Looks like what we thought was a bull trap was actually a bear trap
!!comment!!: Might have to overclock my fiat mining to fund my fomo
!!comment!!: Hi guys, here after a long time. Feeling really down with irl events lately 🙁 Hope you all are doing good, atleast someone else is living the good life.
!!comment!!: BTC formed GOLDEN CROSS. Not sure what that means, I think Pope bought some bitcoin
!!comment!!: I don’t want to ruin anyone’s party, but GRT is forming a bear flag in the 1m chart atm.
!!comment!!: Y’all were calling bull trap but that was actually a bear trap
!!comment!!: If we get improved CPI numbers next week that’s a strikeout for the bears
!!comment!!: I just doubled my money on GRT. Well thank you Coinbase Earn for that free GRT.
!!comment!!: My dad is a crypto skeptic and one of my goals is to be able to buy him a new car (nothing too fancy) to replace his old one using my crypto profits.
!!comment!!: Can someone explain how exactly GRT counts as an AI coin? 
I got lucky in that I bought a bunch of it last summer, but that was because I'd read about how important the indexing would be. I knew nothing about its association with AI.
!!comment!!: Idk about you guys, but I'm buying up any quality alts that are still down 90%+ from their ATH. That's a minimum 10x just to get back to a price they already were. 

Just in case you weren't aware, here are a few examples that Reddit has liked in the past: GRT, ALGO, ONE, THETA, HOT, SAND, CRO, RUNE, VET, the list goes on. All over 90% down.

Edit: Totally did not realize it was my cake day. Thanks guys!
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: My portfolio is up $8 today. Is there any crypto sub for whales? I don’t wanna breathe the same air with you peasants.
!!comment!!: Great another useless avatar added to my collection! Bullish
!!comment!!: BTC is up 45% since the Nov-22 low $15742
!!comment!!: I know this sub hates AI coins, but these dang things are pumping 🤷‍♂️
!!comment!!: You guys keep talking about fet and singularity and what not, show some love to the top of the list of AI coins my boy The Graph. 

Please please I am still 70% down.
!!comment!!: I work in IT.  Honestly, every man and his dog is talking about ChatGPT and AI at the moment.    The OpenAI API is pretty good and a licence to print money.  You pay for the text you pass in and pay for the text you pass out.

Obviously crypto wants a part of that.  Certainly it will crash and burn, but will it crash sooner or later, that is the real question.
!!comment!!: AI Just won't go down. Been tracking RNDR, FET and AGIX in the top 100 and every time there is a pull-back, there is a bounce up to a new level no matter what BTC does.

Not sure how long it will last, but I suppose with inflation stats out tonight, it might make a move in a big way up or down.
!!comment!!: FOMO into GRT, FET and RNDR?

Yes or no?
!!comment!!: The GRT supply change really screwed a lot of early adopters, crazy to see how far it is from ATH even with current hype
!!comment!!: Brb I’m about to fomo chase a pump
!!comment!!: I think I’m about to hit my first 100% profit on a coin. I started in 2021 but only focused on my main 3 coins. This year i switched up and took a bet 3 weeks ago and it’s paying off. Feels good!
!!comment!!: I must admit, even though my redditt nft's are limited, I enjoy changing my avatar more than a grown man should.
!!comment!!: My bank refused me making a deposit to Kraken yesterday, despite allowing this previously (including last month). Co-operative Bank (UK). Dinosaurs.
!!comment!!: I'm looking at buying some Moons on MEXC, I'm normally just a buy bitcoin from Coinbase and send to my ledger guy but I fancy having a stack of Moons to strut around this sub with, plus they've got future potential I expect. 

Is there a decent post about this? 

I'm thinking I've got to send USDT to MEXC wallet, buy moons with a USDT,  then send to my Reddit Vault address? Is that about it?
!!comment!!: i lost my appetite after things happened around me.(in Turkey) we're living on the edge of death my friends. Just enjoy the moment.
!!comment!!: "Don't FOMO into GRT", they told me last month... "don't chase a pump"... "it won't hold $0.08"...
!!comment!!: Love you ETH, you are my only hope
!!comment!!: JPOW pump and dump.. gross.
!!comment!!: Accumulated some coins during that little pump, pump got cancelled & went back to where it started. My apologies ladies & gentleman.
!!comment!!: Balls deep in Shitcoins. Hold my beer.
!!comment!!: Trade the short term outlook 

Invest the long term outlook 

Don’t mix up both or you’ll get rekt
!!comment!!: This organic price movement is great!
!!comment!!: Did anyone see the Binance.US bitcoin chart last night? That candle to 17k is scary. I’m assuming a shit ton of liquidations happened, orders filled, etc. anyone affected?
!!comment!!: A steady market can be boring in the short term but you will love those long term gains
!!comment!!: The beauty of DCA is that I genuinely don't give a shit what the market does. I'll buy every 2 weeks, stake what can be staked, and leave the rest to the crypto gods.
!!comment!!: Seems like we‘re just waiting for ETH to get its own golden cross event around the 12th before we can blast off.
!!comment!!: Dollar going down again

Time for sneks
!!comment!!: How is everyone doing today? Congrats to GRT hodlers
!!comment!!: Just DCA some BTC, feeling good. What about you guys?
!!comment!!: Ok stock market closed now lets continue pumping
!!comment!!: Time for all coins from 2017 to rebrand into AI coins. Very sure this is happening.
!!comment!!: Looks like metaverse coins are about to be the flavor of the week soon
!!comment!!: I'm demanding the gulf countries go 100% into crypto after the oil era, Thanks.
!!comment!!: Every coin will pump except for the ones I have and things won’t stop pumping until I fomo. But I’ll never fomo, so you’re welcome guys.
!!comment!!: Good morning from Aus, have a good one!
!!comment!!: It's 2 years this week since I first jumped into crypto. Was just checking through my portfolio and notes to see some stats.

At either extreme the furthest I've been is -52% and +94%. 

Biggest losses - thought I could beat the bots on new token launches in 2021. DODO and ALICE. Lost about $130 before moving the rest to BTC 

Biggest single profit - LUNA around the time of the crash and bounce. 72x. Put in $10.80, pulled out $780.

I sold some FTM last month so I'm still an idiot at times. 

Generally, if there's one thing I'd wish I'd done better it would be to take MORE profits.
!!comment!!: I took double my profits from GRT of the initial investment I put in during december and put it in BTC. I'm letting the rest of my investment ride out which makes it easy to have no regrets. This is my strategy for lower cap alt coins from now on, you can't guarantee they will make it which makes them high risk compared to BTC/ETH (in an already high risk market).  


During 2020/2021 I made the mistake of holding onto coins which pumped hard for too long (ADA/LRC/LINK) without taking enough profits so I made up a strategy to give me zero stress and it guarantees you will double your initial BTC stack investment (or you can take out the investment amount in USD/EUROS if you want). If you take out your investment plus profits of the same amount as your investment in an alt coin it gives you insurance you at least made some profits, and if the pump on the coin was big enough (almost 400% in GRT case) you will have enough of the alt coin left which makes it easier to cope when you see the coin down 90%+ when you wake up one day.
!!comment!!: Well. It finally happened. I dropped my phone in the toilet.

After I peed. 🙃🙃🙃
!!comment!!: How do I get moons? I have activated my vault 
I want to gift moons!
!!comment!!: just took a 14X profit on AGIX. just couldn't resist that kind of percentage of gains.
!!comment!!: To buy more AGIX or not to buy more AGIX?
!!comment!!: I think we should fund crabbing initiatives to make crabs go extinct. Then the bulls shall reign supreme.
!!comment!!: Testing out my eagles avatar!
!!comment!!: What’s your goal for amount of moons you’d like? Mine is 10k by end of year if possible only through earning them
!!comment!!: I get irrationally excited when new avatars roll out
!!comment!!: 2 more hours night shift left.

Tonight I have decided nightshifts are worse than red dildo days. 

Tick,tock,tick,tock..
!!comment!!: With the amount of crypto commercials last year, I should have took that as a sign to get the hell out of the markets, thank god there are non this year
!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - February 11, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: Friday night and my crush went to dinner and a concert with some no-coiner instead of coming over and looking at my NFT collection 😢
!!comment!!: Just heard the SEC tried to shoot down the crypto industry over Alaska
!!comment!!: When I die, I want Link to lower me into my grave so it can let me down one last time
!!comment!!: Only 10 people here. Half of them are bots. So only 5 real people.

Here, I'll buy you all  breakfast.
!!comment!!: Got an email talking about “your withdrawal of 0.74 BTC is complete, click this link to view full transaction” LOL I wish I had that much money
!!comment!!: Crypto is helping me retire early because the stress reduces my life expectancy
!!comment!!: If the next bull run doesn’t give us 100k then I’m gonna move to a remote shack and rock in a corner for eternity
!!comment!!: Arsenal dropped more points than my portfolio has today
!!comment!!: 17 People here tonight! 

Let's say half of them are bots, that leaves 9 real people.

9 real people, I'll buy a drink for! What's your poison!
!!comment!!: Meh old daily just ended when i made this comment but let me repeat its important : 

"I just got a reminder so to say from another comment.

Did you guys notice how ALL the comments are gone asking about how much you hold in a bearmarket? I just never comes up

You know why ? Because that were all scammers trying to get data from people here so they can impersonate you with CS

So try not to tell everyone your exchange/gender/age/living location and things like your real life name

If you have any of that info in your reddit comments delete that crap and dont fall for it once the masses come back

Ohh also check if you got random followers to your account. Thats all bots scanning your comments for such data. Block em"

Just saw such a comment asking for peoples age. Its not save that this person is a scammer.. what is save is that scammers will see it and note it down

Edit : Also you should now.. if you delete something yourself it cant be restored even with undelete reddits. So if a mod removed it go into your comment history and delete it there as well
!!comment!!: After watching a video by Gary Gensler on crypto staking today I’m now bullish on crypto regulation. I misspoke yesterday on this general chat, he’s not trying to screw Americans in crypto he just wants exchanges to be transparent about how they use American’s crypto when it is staked. Super bullish and bought more today
!!comment!!: According to my hamster we will pump to 25k next week. Get ready frens.
!!comment!!: thank you SEC for allowing me to explore other staking options
!!comment!!: Up way too early and the first thing I do is check the charts and see what's happening in here, do I have a problem
!!comment!!: Eat, sleep, shitpost, repeat
!!comment!!: Alright, I'm warning you, the first one of you to call this a pump is getting slapped
!!comment!!: No ones said it in a while so, fuck Gary and the SEC
!!comment!!: Decided to mix things up today, decided to dabble into DEX's for the first time, had some fun using fusion on 1inch....

After all my onramping, fee payments... just noticed you can directly buy ETH into metamask via a coinbase integration. FML
!!comment!!: Still operating at a half Bitcoin and half fiat portfolio. Trying to time these pumps is a huge risk and it can backfire in an instant.

EDIT: just a little bit of advice to anybody that might value it... This isn't the sort of market condition that I'd be looking to day-trade in. Too unpredictable. Crabbing doesn't equate to low-risk. This is actually the sort of scenario where DCA is probably a good shout if you have the surplus income to facilitate it. I rarely promote DCA but it's very much an accumulation scenario.
!!comment!!: Imagine going out on a weekend instead of sitting alone in the dark on your couch shit posting about crypto. Lol.
!!comment!!: Hey hey new daily same shitposting :))
!!comment!!: DCA day, what a good way to start the weekend.
!!comment!!: So… when does jpm throw coinbase out as a client? 

Context - https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-banking-services-crypto-exchanges-coinbase-gemini/577758/

Given the past week, I can imagine reg pressure will impact the amount of  reputational risk that jpm is willling to take in
!!comment!!: Reddit has given way over a million of Super Bowl NFTs.
!!comment!!: Good morning everyone. Day off from the fiat mine today, but up early watching the charts with the baby. Hope we get some green this weekend.
!!comment!!: Reading some more anti-crypto shit by old media here in Australia; glad I have you degens and true believers to relate to 💚
!!comment!!: Price action tightening for a slingshot up? Or another leg down?
!!comment!!: To the 15 people here rn: There's an error/glitch in the official Reddit app (EDIT: and the desktop browser) at the moment that's why you see so many duplicated comments. They aren't spamming/flooding deliberately
!!comment!!: LRC is back on the menu booys
!!comment!!: Oh yeah I'm back after a year of inactivity. Hi!
!!comment!!: My averages in USDT are -(top 4 in portfolio)

BTC @ 40K

ETH @ 3.1K

SOL @ 108

ADA @ 1.2 


Am I doomed?
!!comment!!: Is "Wen Kraken?" the new "Wen Mainnet?"?
!!comment!!: So 2K comments on the daily these days. 
Remember when we had 10K by breakfast.
!!comment!!: I’m sick of hearing about kraken, PayPal, the SEC and SBF. Broken record much. Reading the Daily before bed is my little oasis of calm
!!comment!!: Dude the cc moons charts look fantastic.  The estimator?  Wow I can see my activity and everything since round 13.  Unbelievable.  And I’m on track for 200 karma 💪
!!comment!!: I hope everyone here enjoys their weekend, more green and peace of mind 💚❤
!!comment!!: Happy Saturday and Super Bowl weekend for all for those that watch!
!!comment!!: Buying opportunities guys 🚀🚀
!!comment!!: Me and crypto have had terrible timing as of lately.  😞
!!comment!!: Will there be a super bowl pump?
!!comment!!: Saturday fiat mining needs to be recognised for the evil it is
!!comment!!: We are officially in a Slidemarket
!!comment!!: HBAR looking beautiful tonight! Was hoping it would come back down some to buy more cheaper but seeing the big green in the portfolio is nice as well!
!!comment!!: So, we crabbin again now or what?
!!comment!!: Hope you have a good weekend guys, cheers from Europe.
!!comment!!: All I want is moons to go to 1$
!!comment!!: ROSE trying to break the ceiling again...need to pass 0.1 and then fly
!!comment!!: Which comment got you an incredible amount of karma?
!!comment!!: Could someone ELI5 to me how this new karma and moons system works? Did something change? Last month, I was supposed to get more moons, but I only got little, so I wonder how that can be?
!!comment!!: I'd recommend watching the Netflix documentary about Bernie Madoff if you haven't watched it.

One thing struck me about it was how chronically underfunded the SEC claimed to be. But even so it seems they've been spending a huge amount of resources anf focus on CryptoCurrency recently.
!!comment!!: Good morning to the 12 people along me here
!!comment!!: The amount of crypto-related bullshit available on YouTube is stunning
!!comment!!: My holdings at the moment are half Bitcoin and half fiat. Feel like that's a sensible, low-risk approach, particularly because I don't know whether we're done dipping yet. Wouldn't be surprised if we see a couple more red candles on the 4H charts which will weed out longs and allow whales to accumulate.
!!comment!!: Doing my DCA today fuck it
!!comment!!: Will we break 2k comments today? I think not
!!comment!!: Eth holding this 1500 level pretty well, as long as Btc doesn’t decide to take a dip below 21.2k, which we haven’t touched yet but that’s where the support is, we should hopefully resume the bullish momentum this coming week. That could all get reversed if cpi comes in hot though, if we beat expectations though on the cpi, we are definitely looking at some new bullish movements for at least a couple of weeks
!!comment!!: Do BTC poker tables exist online ?
!!comment!!: At least my $10 of HBAR is doing well
!!comment!!: A month ago  Rocketpool was #115 on coin gecko. 

The other day it was #50.  Currently #56.  

And this one doesnt have quintillions of supply.  Just 19 million.
!!comment!!: So my CDC card is supposed to give me a rebate for spotify but hasnt for the last 2 months. Anyone else run into this? Know a solution?
!!comment!!: Just watched the lasted Coffezilla video. Just goes to show that all these "influencers" will accept money from anyone to promote anythig. If they don't even read the contract they are signing, how are they making sure they are promoting a good and legit project?
!!comment!!: Saturday shift done and dusted!

The things we do for DCA money.
!!comment!!: damn those free nft dm starting again :-( start of bullrun I quess
!!comment!!: Forget crypto when will I gain a gf man
!!comment!!: Holy shit I am now a proud owner of 1 whole ETH. I’m not even 20 years old so don’t make fun of me please… 1 BTC next

!!comment!!: It's been a while since I shit posted here. Sup folks
!!comment!!: My little sister wanted me to buy doge because the coin looked cute but I didnt buy. It was under a cent back then 🥲
!!comment!!: Coingecko burned another 25740 moons for another 7 days to rent the banner!🔥

!!comment!!: Sell pressure dying out. If next week is not fucked by sec again we should see some recovery to 22.5k soon
!!comment!!: Everyone keeps saying Moons won't get listed on big exchanges, which probably means they will
!!comment!!: my plan is to accumulate till next halving. regardless of ups and downs, my plan will not deviate.
!!comment!!: Damn posted in the last daily right as this one went up! Just going to repost this here, my bad

Got a promotion at work and getting back into crypto after an extended hiatus due to life getting in the way. 

Any big news or changes I miss? Besides the major crypto crash which happened right as I had to stop investing so I missed so much opportunities to DCA :(
!!comment!!: Blessed them with my snek
!!comment!!: Man, y'all this week has me beat. Looking forward to a nice green weekend hopefully.
!!comment!!: One day closer to the bull!!!!
!!comment!!: SBF have had multiple meetings with SEC. 

Wonder how many meetings Kraken had regarding the staking issue? Or was it a sudden lawsuit like with Ripple?
!!comment!!: Who thinks it was an alien spacecraft in Alaska
!!comment!!: What the fuck happened to Coinbase Pro?! I was trying to make a purchase and was redirected to Coinbase Advanced Trading but fees on the app are still high??

Is there anywhere else I should start purchasing or staking ETH with lower fees?
!!comment!!: my gut says we drop again this weekend, so while i bought a little today i'm holding off to see how things play out with the rest.
!!comment!!: LTC halving in August any others this year?
!!comment!!: Welcome to the weekend and may the candles forever be in your favor.
!!comment!!: I was a little rattled by the Kracken thing yesterday, but not rattled enough not to buy the dip today. One of these days all these dips will really pay off.
!!comment!!: Has anyone been able to successfully send their moons from Reddit to an external wallet? Would they be stored on Arbitrum nova ? And how do I get Eth in my reddit account to pay for the gas fee ?
!!comment!!: Good morning my fellow crypto analysts!
!!comment!!: Give me your favourite degen defi play of the day

!!comment!!: A bit more of btc to weight the bag. First buy since January
!!comment!!: Crypto has it's ups and downs, but think about your mental health as well.
!!comment!!: Any suggestion who will will Superbowl?  
Will there be any Crypto Ads?
!!comment!!: If I was good at crypto as I am at making a grilled cheese. I'd have a boat by now
!!comment!!: Do you guys trade with spot or play with margin and futures ?
!!comment!!: Question regarding SEC and centralized staking. Would it affect holders in Binance International? Or just Binance US, if ever?
!!comment!!: The Chart from aptos is clearly manipulation.
!!comment!!: This shouldn't even be called crabbing anymore. It's worming now.
!!comment!!: I think we're going to be green tomorrow
!!comment!!: Good morning. How are we Lal enjoying our day off?
!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - February 2, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: If I fomo in to this semi-sketchy microcap I'm gonna get rugged but if I don't it's gonna do another 10x without me. Schrödinger's shitcoin basically.
!!comment!!: I have not accumulated enough damn it.
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|YBthmI0H75ySwVSx4T|downsized)

!!comment!!: i don't want to be rich, i don't want a lambo...i want a down payment on a house and to pay off my student loans.

!!comment!!: BTC just broke through $24k (and quickly retreated lolz)
!!comment!!: Extreme greed is back on the menu
!!comment!!: No matter how much you buy it feels like not enough when the price goes up.
!!comment!!: This sub is about to get a lot more crowded in the coming weeks…
!!comment!!: People not wanting to miss the next bull run

!!comment!!: Btc or alts ... which season is up in the rotation?
!!comment!!: Today's a good day to be a Cosmos maxi. Atom will be at the forefront of the next bull i'm sure of it!
!!comment!!: Welp, just got laid off! Didn’t think this layoff spree was going to hit me but here we are. 

I have plenty of savings so I’m not worried. And I’m sure I’ll find another job easily.

But I’ll have to pause my DCA for now. That’s honestly the worst part
!!comment!!: Alts doing some big upward movement today
!!comment!!: LRC about to rip through .40 cents with the help of BTC  @ 24k beautiful.
!!comment!!: Ok ADA, now break the $4 mark pls
!!comment!!: I just had a terrifying thought: how long until AI becomes advanced enough to shit post? What will become of me!?!
!!comment!!: Well, I am almost at the point where I sell 1/2 my position at double profit.

That free $1 in RH AVAX has been putting in the work!
!!comment!!: What obscure coins are you guys bullish on?
!!comment!!: Damn, I have not missed that feeling of needing to check the chart for every coin I own every 5 min.  Someone rip this optimism out of my soul!
!!comment!!: I don't even need to see the charts, all these snek awards tell the story! 🍻🍻
!!comment!!: My legit condolences to ALBT holders.  I read the postmortem and that's the kind of shit that scares me the most.  AllianceBlock didn't get hacked or anything.  110 million of their 1 billion supply was drained (and sold) on the Bonq protocol (whatever the fuck that is) causing a massive collapse of the token value.  My first question is why is 10% of the total supply on some obscure protocol?  But even worse is that AllianceBlock is now minting a new token (out of panic imho).  

What a disaster.  Hard to see them rebounding from this, but it is possible I suppose.  I guess the lesson is if you're serious about your project don't lend 10% of your supply to some no-name defi protcol.  Idk, maybe AllianceBlock is sketchier than I give them credit for.
!!comment!!: What's your guys thoughts on a decentralized website that it's focus is Steam (the gaming platform) trading. It uses smart contracts to assist in safe trading.

Both parties agree to the trade which then triggers the smart contracts and only once both accept.

Basically you'd drag your items or currency into the trade slot and then it will allow you to select a box where it ticks off - which will then lock your trading box so nothing can move in and/or out, with a 10-second timer going down to give you chance to look over and make sure both sides of the trade is what both parties were looking for, after that 10 seconds the accept or trade button goes green and both parties are then able to accept, trigger the smart contract and complete the trade. 

There can also be a chat box added to keep communication there for both parties but with privacy still in place having no access of knowing who you are talking to.
!!comment!!: Are we going to see MATIC above 2$ this 2023? I have a feeling that it will happen
!!comment!!: I feel my LRC bags getting lighter :))))
!!comment!!: I’m an Algorand bag holder and it’s the only alt in the top alts that hasn’t reached a new 7 day all time high. I hate myself for buying this so much. Shib and dog would have been better than this
!!comment!!: What are the top 3 best performers of your portfolio in the past 24h? % wise

For me its
1. LRC
2. ONE (very tiny bag, but still 🤣)
3. MATIC, the beautiful

Curious what you guys are going mention🤭

Have a great day all!
!!comment!!: sooo ada looking very bullish !

!!comment!!: From r/superstonk

Shorts are getting Rekt (Liquidations) - $500k worth of LRC shorts in the past 24 hours

https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData

What I find most interesting is that some of these are LRC-USDT-SWAP and LRCUSDT from Binance. Tether is being used to suppress LRC (as well as other cryptos).

- u/surf243
!!comment!!: The shorts are getting liquidated and a speed today, everyone will be going long then BOOM price drops and its disastrous for the longs too. Classic
!!comment!!: Be careful, we have not seen any major correction yet. I think we may see 22k in following days.

!!comment!!: [I've completed my daily purchase of LTC](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16bzUnGeE9orCoe5g35xsWNTXAXNuAygUJJKzxmIjWR8/edit?usp=sharing). I'm on a journey to buy at least [$20 a day every day](https://np.reddit.com/r/LitecoinMarkets/comments/ukto93/comment/i7vn88c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Today I bought 0.2 LTC. This is my 271st day of purchasing; 181 days remain until halving. Feels good to be entirely positive :)
!!comment!!: The bears are getting agitated. They're predicting laugable reversals and are becoming openly hostile. To me, this posturing smacks of desperation and I think it's a pretty bullish sign that they are just about exhausted. Enjoy hibernation bears, see you sometime after the halving. ✌🏼
!!comment!!: New day. More gains. Let's gooo
!!comment!!: Atom and moons carrying my portfolio, also GET and MATIC

!!comment!!: For anyone interested FOMC meeting is in 5.50 hours as I type this out so you can add this to your local time
!!comment!!: Goodbye January, may February bring us more joy
!!comment!!: There's way too much confidence in a 25 BPS hike.

Rates currently sit at 4.25%-4.50% after all these hikes that ended the 0% era: 25, 50, 75, 75, 75, 75, 50....

The pattern is obvious... too obvious. Everything points towards 25 BPS, which even makes sense if they're going to have 8 meetings this year to increase a further 2% before they settle on 6.25%-6.50% for a quarter or two before pivoting.

Is there any reason the Fed would do 50 just to fuck with everyone? Would they have any justification?
!!comment!!: So crab until FED meeting? Anyone know how many hours of waiting left?
!!comment!!: Cramer: buy

Burry: sell 

Fed: economy needs to slow down for 2% inflation 

Who do we listen to?
!!comment!!: hear me out here I have bipolar and I am convinced this sub has a collective bipolar disorder. Definitely some rapid cycling going on ..
!!comment!!: It’s a good day for cosmonauts

!!comment!!: Good morning all! Anyone hoping to load up a bit on any dips and then we can rip?
!!comment!!: So, you make a lot of money with crypto, would you rather invest it in real estate or keep in crypto and earn from staking? Both examples would bring you passive income, with difference that real estate is more secure and won't have variations in price.
!!comment!!: Anyone listening to the crypto segment on BBC2? Some actual moonboi came on talking about hodling and that he was gonna retire in the next bull via XRP
!!comment!!: Every day I earn a little more ETH. Life is good!

!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|trN9ht5RlE3Dcwavg2|downsized)
!!comment!!: Extremely dovish comments from Powell holy shit, saying a soft landing is basically the base scenario right now. Seems like the pivot everyone has been waiting for. 

Great news for the markets today.

Powell is dovish AF!

!!comment!!: I wanted to be a wholecoiner for such a long time but it felt impossible at the peak of the last bull run with crazy prices. Thanks to the long bear market and continued DCA every week, I'm finally the proud owner of 1 DOT.
!!comment!!: Anyone else get tagged in a shiba air drop? Didnt trust it
!!comment!!: Gooodmorning friends :))) 
Back in the mines again but that’s okay

Tonight I’m having a big dinner with my roommates since one is moving away, very excited to eat her food cuz she’s a bomb cook but sad she is leaving 

Hope we have continued greeeeen and everyone has a serene day
!!comment!!: Investing in crypto is incredible. I always thought I would never be able to pay off my mortgage and student loans. Crypto proved me right.
!!comment!!: So this is kind of neat...

Apparently, Coinbase has been running a Knicks contest which I was automatically entered into when I bought USDC.

Last Thursday, Coinbase reached out to me saying I was one of the winners selected for 4 free tickets to next week's game against the Nets at MSG. 

Thought it was a scam at first, but turned out to be legit. Filled out the paperwork and just got the tickets today!

Now, I just need to win a dozen more times to break even on my crypto.

!!comment!!: Hey cryptoland, how are you guys doing today?
!!comment!!: 99 percent sure I’m just going to play with myself all day…..


Mash-ups.  

Eyes up here bud.
!!comment!!:  So we usually pump a bit before the FOMC, does anyone think the pump will continue if a 25bp hike is announced?
!!comment!!: Nasa just found a face of a bear on Mars
!!comment!!: Just a warning... I bought
!!comment!!:  I’m just curious, when did you guys all join this subreddit ?
!!comment!!: I think it’s safe to add an egg to our ramen today
!!comment!!: Who thinks Powell will try to talk down the market tomorrow while still falling in line with expectations?
!!comment!!: Last year I was sitting in a cabin in the woods reading the daily and I read a comment from this crazy dude who said he was buying LTC daily and keeping track of it in a spreadsheet.

He even shared his spreadsheet, and I thought to myself "Well, here I am in a cabin in the woods, living my best life and doing what I said I wanted to do, and this guy's going to be living his best life by accumulating all this LTC before the halving, and he's so confident he's showing us how much skin he has in the game!"

So I started accumulating right there and then.

LTC is now my biggest bag with an average cost of $57.87.

LTC dude, wherever you are, may your ramen have an egg in it today 🙏
!!comment!!: Data from IntoTheBlock suggests that 64% of Bitcoin investors are now in profit, and those who invested in 2019 are seeing an average profit of 9%.

Invested in BTC in 2021, so this gives me reassurance that I will turn it into a profit one of these days! 👆🏽

!!comment!!: Kinda surprised Moons still holding 12 cents.
!!comment!!: We're in a bear, bull bear bull..... I don't know market.
!!comment!!: My biggest surprise for this January has been FTM rising from the ashes with a +140% over the month 👻
!!comment!!: Is there a website that tells you the BEST rates for swaps? Like instead of my checking LoopRing, 1inch, sushiswap etc, there must be a site that shows you all the rates for all the DEXs?
!!comment!!: So I know Matic has pumped hard the last 30 days and has done extremely well over the last 9 months.  Not complaining, but would expect a much larger pump assuming the the zkEVM launch goes according to plan.  To my knowledge (which is to be debated) their team has a pretty good reputation for success.  They say it will go live in 1st quarter.  Just curious if this is rocket waiting to go higher or is the launch “priced in” and this is orbit?
!!comment!!: This month's paycheck is ready for whatever happens tomorrow.

25 BPS hike pump, dump and crab? Ready. 50 BPS hike dump, pump and crab? Ready. 75 BPS dump, dump, and dump? READY.

I thought I was gonna sit on them forever. Sigh of relief
!!comment!!: I know I'm kinda alone with this, but I don't consider 5-10% up or down a dip or a rally when talking about Bitcoin. Is more like crabbing. We crabbed around 17 for a long time, now we crab around 22-23

!!comment!!: How does a crypto site report gains to the IRS if I just send them crypto in my personal wallet that I've had there for 3 years...and only cash out on their site?  How could they know how to calculate my profit in their tax report that they send to the IRS?

!!comment!!: Bullrun dreams poppin like the Chinese weather balloon
!!comment!!: I know this isnt going to be accurate data, but everyones waiting for moons to moon… so a question, how many of you have actually bought moons?
!!comment!!: I got Chiefs number 69. Lol
!!comment!!: I predict a massive pump and this combination of Golden Cross and Death Cross will be known as The Divine Ascension from now on 👼
!!comment!!: I’ve recently learned about chatgpt and it’s uses. Then my new job tells me that we are to start using AI to help us create more content. Our purpose is just to fact check it and proofread it. 

This blows my tiny mind. Im very new in the industry and am already thinking writing may not be the best industry to get into if a bot can do my job but better and faster. At the moment it still needs us to operate it but I can’t help but feel like this is the beginning of something greater.

Only time will tell….but I think I may have to reconsider my career options

!!comment!!: Been trading up and down past 2 and half weeks. Turned my 38 usd to 305usd. Sent 200 of eth to TW for safe keeping. Gonna trade 100. Wish me luck guys.
!!comment!!: I personally wouldn't buy the dip this early.  The whales tend to slowly bleed out the price actions over a long timescale so the fish who have FOMO start buying at any 3-5% dips.
!!comment!!: Good morning all l, hope you have a good week at the fiat mines
!!comment!!: I bought at 24k with liquidation at 16k, I dun goofed innit?
!!comment!!: New FTX CEO Ray was paid $690,000 for his first weeks on the job. The cycle continues.

!!comment!!: Not sure, but ETH looks like it is tired of crabbing and ready for take off.

!!comment!!: Bought some more Bitcoin.

Good to hear people that have had high political positions think this way. It can only help with adoption.

What can go wrong
!!comment!!: I’ve rebalanced my portfolio so many times, i don’t even know what my cost basis is any more 🤪
!!comment!!: Another week of fiat mining is another DCA
!!comment!!: I don’t think my heart can handle the next bull market. Still get sick to my stomach thinking of how much I left on the table last time around.
!!comment!!: Greetings from Europe. Stay strong Turkish neighbors.
!!comment!!: Market crashes 2% and everyone loses their shit. There’s never been a straight line up. Still hopeful for a good week.
!!comment!!: looking to buy some extra ada where.do you stake them?
!!comment!!: Guess what : 


I bought more
!!comment!!: Wishing everyone a great day and lots of green. Feeling okayish about the current environment despite lots of uncertainties. Keep DCAing frens.
!!comment!!: Still feeling good about the weeks to come.
!!comment!!: Hello everyone from Sydney! Here for work. It’s 10.30 pm Monday night and the week of fiat mining has started off strong! The hash rate is high! I’m going to watch the Last of Us then go to sleep. Good night all! Have a great day!
!!comment!!: I'm planning on staking some of my funds on kraken long term, is it safu?
!!comment!!: Sorry for the duplicate, but the question was burried earlier.. Do I understand correctly that moons from all burns help shaping up higher ratio of current round? AMAs/Banners/Bridge to Nova/MoonPlace ones?
!!comment!!: This morning as the stock market opened I played around with 50x leverage trading on GMX. I was not liquidated but did sell at a 10-15% loss. I was only playing around with $20. I cannot imagine gambling $100, $1000, or more. It's stressful enough watching the charts move against your position even when it's that small.

Glad to experience it, but my fantasy of day trading was ended abruptly.
!!comment!!: Got two weeks of full home office. Bullish.
!!comment!!: >Fox sells out Super Bowl ads: crypto out, alcohol in. "There’s zero representation in that category on the day at all" says Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports.

GOOD! When you start seeing superbowl ads for crypto, that's when you sell lol. Now is when you buy!

!!comment!!: I pray for one more year of accumulation. Vote Bullrun 2024
!!comment!!: Happy Monday everyone and a great start in to the week. Let’s hope for some green days and more adoption.
!!comment!!: The Grammys show was cool. They showed the crypto.com label a couple times maybe since it was at that arena. 

Back to looking at charts
!!comment!!: Is it worth using keplr to stake or better to stake on coinbase?
!!comment!!: this is the real cryptocurrency we are used to.
!!comment!!: What do u guys think will happen Tmr , I’m thinking a red day
!!comment!!: Original plan for 2023: Big caps only, switch to shitcoins closer to 2024. BTC > ETH > DOT.

Reality: DOT, TAO, GLMR, METIS, EFI, AVAX, ETH, BTC, ASTR.

..That escalated quickly. Can recommend Bittensor (TAO). AI chain on Polkadot which held up during this latest dip. A bit quirky to get but should get some cex listings later this month.
!!comment!!: Another fight for 23k, getting my $20 ready
!!comment!!: OCEAN breaking new barriers
!!comment!!: We wanna see green candle again
!!comment!!: The next avatars will drop soon, this time it's gonna be Superbowl themed. 

For us non Americans: Which team should we pick? 

We don't know shit about fuck.
!!comment!!: I've been here for 2 years, so proud of how moons have kept their value and how this community is still great!
!!comment!!: I just checked unstoppable domains. Am I misunderstanding the website? It seems that they want between 1000 and 100000 USD for most domains. On ENS I pay 5 USD per year for my .eth addresses which seems like a much better deal. 

I just wanted some domains without ETH in the name to use for other cryptocurrencies
!!comment!!: If you use kraken, they enabled two kinds aus staking for a few coins recently, e.g. DOT. you can now either stake and unstake immediately or have an unstaking period of about 20 days depending on the coin but get much higher apy.

They also added 2.5% APY for Euro fiat which is nice.
!!comment!!: Dip on AGIX. Will happily buy again if it goes lower.
!!comment!!: Whats the most ridiculous Technical Analysis term you've got in your arsenal?
!!comment!!: Hi. Anyone here has pooled liquidity using hop exchange?
!!comment!!: I've closed all my defi positions on Near, swapped all the rewards and tokens for some Near and staked it. These positions were too little to bother with all the necessary process.

I've done it mostly to test their ecosystem and i gotta say it's pretty fluid and fast
!!comment!!: Gooodmorning friends :)))

Back in the mines we gooooo

Hoping for more green as the day proceeds
!!comment!!: Afternoon all.
How's everyone!?

!!comment!!: Another dip, another buy, in 2025 will I laugh or will I cry?
!!comment!!: Legit question: do you think I’m too late for the $MATIC train?
!!comment!!: After a couple weeks struggling to break that 23k we're beginning to test it as the floor. Couple bumps off there this morning. I think we'll see alot of chop this week and we'll see if it can hold.
!!comment!!: Just bought the dip so will probably go down some more
!!comment!!: Moonplace tile #0 just sold for .450 ETH 👀
!!comment!!: Time to hit the sheets, got the fiat mines in the morning; those skates aren’t going to sharpen themselves!

Crab lord is pleased with this

🦀🦀🦀
!!comment!!: No more weekend dip, just weekend crab. Definitely a bullish indicator,
!!comment!!: BNB really taking off right now
!!comment!!: This dip is yet another reminder, to me at least, to take profit when you can.

Hope the incoming week be full of greens. 💚
!!comment!!: Alright guys I woke up after a 7 hour coma and WOAH WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CRYPTOS?!
!!comment!!: [Bitcoin Batman strikes again](https://imgur.com/a/j2lHwUo)
!!comment!!: You can definitely tell whose newer to crypto when they freak out over a dump that is a couple %… I used to be like that but being in crypto long enough has seasoned me to not even react to those
!!comment!!: The dump finally came. I guess it’s back to the usual Sunday’s we have always know.
!!comment!!: [This wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/banner_records/) will track burns from banner rentals. Probably will migrate this page somewhere else at some point but this will work for now
!!comment!!: First time I saw a snake in Australia. May Snake God blesses crypto.
!!comment!!: *\*DefinitelyNotAScammer wants to send you a message\**
!!comment!!: My personal opinion. LTC is a safe bet after BTC
!!comment!!: So that 1 inch banner ad, its been up for more than 3 days. Did they extend their ad time, because if they did that's freakin great at 9k/day Moons burnt.
!!comment!!: Lately the market pumps while I sleep. So I'm gonna take one for the team. Night y'all!
!!comment!!: First sign of incoming red ( i know its 1% for btc and eth 😂) is that shib was pumping
!!comment!!: Yes, yes bitcoin, we get it. You can be red when you want to be. That 1% dip was very scary. Surprised pikachu faces all round. Now let's get back to the gainz.
!!comment!!: Sold AGIX an hour ago and it continues to rise. But, profit is a profit.
!!comment!!: why did everything suddenly turn slightly red?
!!comment!!: Sub keeps talking about AI tokens. But what am I looking for to DYOR on these coins? Is it still early for them or are they like DOGE ATH prices when people were wishing they’d gotten in 6 months earlier?
!!comment!!: I said I was gonna DCA out profits from FET I’m almost up $500 but honestly I’m thankful I don’t need the money at all so I’ll just ride it to the fucking moon or go home.
!!comment!!: 23k fighting for its life rn
!!comment!!: I haven’t seen a battle like this since Helm’s Deep.
!!comment!!: Will start buying more of the dip when bears and buttcoiners start saying "I told you so"
!!comment!!: Finally we are getting the Sunday dip lol
!!comment!!: Of course the single one Altcoin I sell and take profita goes on a fucking rampage and outperforms BTC by 3x while the rest keeps shitting the bed.
!!comment!!: Our only hope now is the stock futures when they open in a few hours🤞
!!comment!!: Sunday being the best day for DCA is not a meme
!!comment!!: Founder of Chainlink Sergey Nazarov bought the domain smartcontract(dot)com 6 days before the bitcoin whitepaper was released. He has the same initials as Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi used an IP address used by a man named Sergey. The second language enabled in the bitcoin talk forum was Russian. Sergey had clearly displayed his affinity for Japanese culture throughout the years. Sergey has backpedaled multiple times the date on which he began to work in crypto.

Do you think he may be satoshi or had a link to him? One of my favorite crypto conspiracies.
!!comment!!: Don’t worry guys, we are 1 day closer to the next bull run
!!comment!!: good night good folks, hope you have a great Saturday night
!!comment!!: What’s up with the SHIB explosion?
!!comment!!: Which 'crypto super power' would you like to have and why?
!!comment!!: Hey all. With Matic, OP, and ImmutableX surging, I've got to aks - has everyone forgotten about loopring?  


Almost never see it mentioned anymore despite afaik being the first zk rollup.  


Not shilling (only have like $50) just surprised to see it so bereft of hype
!!comment!!: If it breaks down here a bit more, the ascending channel will break downward and most likely we see 20-21k.
!!comment!!: Deploying capital, steady lads.
!!comment!!: So AI tokens are the next big thing for the bull?
!!comment!!: OT today, compensated with lieu time so that I can sit on a beach later this month and shit post in the daily.
!!comment!!: Not buying significantly until sub 20k. That being said my auto-invest still doing DCA everyday, which tremendously helps curbing my FOMO.
!!comment!!: What is this, a dump for ants?
!!comment!!: The bears are going to try to break $23k for the thousandth time. Lol
!!comment!!: Bears are gonna take 23k, aren’t they?
!!comment!!: I bet the portfolio of hate is making a killing right now.
!!comment!!: When my wife and I first got together I carved our initials on a tree in her parent's backyard. For our 10th anniversary present I put our initials on the blockchain with my moonplace tiles. She's divorcing me.
!!comment!!: What should I invest in? Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, or my daughter's tuition?
!!comment!!: I miss shitcoin gambling meme coins, but it feels better just sticking to BTC
!!comment!!: Looks like the ugly AF H&S in the 4h finally this time wants to do the play (not like the last one which finished in a catastrophe for every shorter).

Add to it that BTC usually works as a canary in the mine for the Nasdaq on Sundays and we can finally have our red week to cold off a bit. Nothing to worry unless 22.5 first and 20k after are lost.
!!comment!!: Bought some more AVAX. 🤷🏽‍♂️
!!comment!!: moving ETH from Arbitrum Nova to Mainnet takes 7 days... Why didnt anyone tell :D
!!comment!!: Imagine you buy for your born baby some BTC and wait 18 years.
!!comment!!: DCA'd yesterday. Wish I did today. Ah the highs and lows of DCA
!!comment!!: I wonder why GRT is pumping alone
!!comment!!: The Graph had a good day today! Indexing and organizing the blockchain. Great tech, lots of utility. It's a long road to reclaim its ATH.
!!comment!!: In general, investment these days are all about (1) identifying what is a key trend and (2) jumping in early.  It was the same for DEFI, NFT, and now AI.  Really smart investors see the hype on Chat GPT and buys a lot of AI coins the right next day.  And then they sell at the top and wait until the next fad presents itself.  These are the people who make shit load of money in investing these days.
!!comment!!: My feeling is that someday I will be very grateful for having been able to buy a shit load of DOT at a cheap price 🤷‍♂️
!!comment!!: If you didn't sell on green days then now ain't the time to sell imo.
!!comment!!: Sorry everybody, I was up late watching the charts last night and I fell asleep without putting the hummus away so now we've got a dip for germs.
!!comment!!: Prices are going down now

Time to get in and find that last bottom and pack all your bags
!!comment!!: Are "I bought, so it's dipping" jokes always this common or Is it something new?
!!comment!!: Crypto gods. Can we get an alt coin pump this week please?
!!comment!!: Wow I’m surprised only 250 comments
!!comment!!: I bought some more ADA with this dip 🚀
!!comment!!: Bullrun over pack ur bags
!!comment!!: The Daily Discussion never changes, small drop and people are bearish again.
!!comment!!: People really freaking over this ever so slightly bleed?
!!comment!!: Never fucking fails, get a short on a shit coin (GRT) up 30% in two days and it goes higher while bitcoin tanks. Fuck my life man
!!comment!!: Welp there we go, 1.5 year old daughter gave me the flu…

Time for some rest,
Good night people 🌙
!!comment!!: This is one of those buy the dip situations right?
!!comment!!: Are we starting a bull run?
!!comment!!: Is there any direct way to buy Reddit NFT avatars with Moons? Not that I have much but the information can be useful in the future
!!comment!!: YouTube crypto influencers are dastards 

Never knew the word *dastard* existed until today & wanted to apply it 👆🏽
!!comment!!: Commercials told me not to do my taxes
!!comment!!: We have all probably heard the phrase “dumb and happy”.  I feel like after the last year, I’m  “numb and happy”. I’m happy at the way 2023 has started, but feeling numb to all price action, both positive and negative.  I feel like until I have enough to walk away it doesn’t really matter. The last year has truly made me numb to price swings and continue to invest with little emotion, which has actually started to pay off.
!!comment!!: Already the 5th of February. Damn time goes by quick. I guess it ain't so bad when everyday that goes by is one closer to adoption.. and the next bull.

Cheers to all you hodlers and hope you're all having a great weekend!
!!comment!!: Baby Doge is out for a rip.. up 40%
!!comment!!: if BTC hits 25k today, I'm gonna fap
!!comment!!: Anyone else have profit to rebuy with but still hesitant to buy for unknown reasons?
!!comment!!: Looks like in tw the trend is to discover if we re in the rally after the 'anger' (ftx bottom) or already in disbelief.

Personally, it would be a shame if after all this green BTC decided to have a healthy red week... Crushing some hopes
!!comment!!: I miss the Nano boys. No bull run is a true bull run without them.
!!comment!!: Omg this hangover is killing me. I do not want to get out of bed.
!!comment!!: r/Cryptocurrency is my church on Sunday. Now let us pray...

Edit...lesson learned, all of those rewards of a few cents here and there bumped me up into a higher plan based on transactions.  I could have saved 90 bucks by not getting like 30 dollars in rewards :(

!!comment!!: I bought some GALA the other day cause a guy on here was shilling it, and my $25 worth is now worth $26, so don't say that NO ONE has ever made a dollar from r/cc advice.

Of course I'm gonna hodl it til it's worth $10 or less like r/cc taught me, but y'know.
!!comment!!: What happened with the other subs community points?

!!comment!!: It was me. I launched this rally. Almost two months ago I put in orders at increasingly lower ETH prices instead of outright DCAing. ETH never even touched my highest price order, and has increased over 30% since.

!!comment!!: As a long term hodler - maybe mental strategy despite the facts hitting me in the face, but hey ho - I'm still way down on all my crappy alts, but at least it's all looking better again recently on BTC and ETH slowly gaining lost ground, and getting closer to buy price at last.

I always told myself this was a 10 year project, and the big blip recently hasn't put me off. Haven't sold anything last 7 months...

!!comment!!: A bird just shit on my window. This is good for bitcoin.
!!comment!!: Anyone in EU had any recent coinbase learn & earn ? Seems like there’s nothing since 2-3 months at least for me
!!comment!!: So far, Bitcoin holding the daily 8EMA as support (yellow line). Hasn't been lost this whole move up yet.

!!comment!!: As someone who hasn’t experienced a bull run (got in around February/March last year) I don’t know how to feel. Not saying we’re in one but I haven’t seen it go up like this. The hype in the daily is crazy though.
!!comment!!: What the hap is fuckening?
!!comment!!: There are many things I don't understand in this universe but crypto is the thing I most don't understand.
!!comment!!: Reminder that $21k BTC is still cheap

!!comment!!: Anyone else overwhelmed with the flood of prediction polls on the main page?

So you're welcome for selling.

But what is happening??? I've done nothing but lose since I bought in 2 years ago.

Edit: My mistake, bought in November, 2020
!!comment!!: Bitcoin just closed the day above the 200 day moving average for the first time since December 27, 2021.
!!comment!!: I lost all my shorts today. I can finally come clean and just dca and btc and eth. No more gambling with extra steps
!!comment!!: I am glad to announce my portfolio is up 18.71% all time
!!comment!!: Welcome to our 6,000,000th member! Any minute now they’ll drop in!
!!comment!!: The funny thing that is going to happen to everyone who didn’t take profit at 60k in 2021, is that they are going to sell a big stack at 60k when Bitcoin gets back there, to lock in profit and not make the mistake of not selling again, and then it’s going to rocket to like 150, 200k and every post here will be people crying that they sold at 60k.
!!comment!!: Brings back September flashbacks when BTC jumped from $18,500 to 22k within a week

!!comment!!: when LINK gets to about 40$, sell
!!comment!!: Do you remember the insane liquidation event on 4 December 2021? Bitcoin fell from $54K to $42K in a day. This is the same thing but "in reverse".

Back then everyone believed we were going to $100K and this candle crushed the bulls. Now everyone believes we go to $10K and this candle crushed the bears.

!!comment!!: Good morning daily! It's Monday morning 9.25 am here in Australia, and I'm dropping by while mining fiat from the office. Right now on an MS Teams meeting. Hope you all have had a great weekend. Will lurk and catch up with everyone later!
!!comment!!: i gotta learn when to take profits before next bull.
!!comment!!: Moons are mooning! If we keep adding use cases we will easily hit $1 and more🚀
!!comment!!: When - not if - MOONS reaches SHIB's current market cap, each moon will be at roughly $92.

Let that🚰 in
!!comment!!: Does this pump make sense to you? I mean out of blue we are suddenly up. Can it be a trap before FED meeting?
!!comment!!: 445 days since Bitcoin's all time high. It feels like yesterday yet ages ago at the same time.
!!comment!!: What happened?

I just took a nap and when I woke up, I earned more than working my ass off an entire day.
!!comment!!: Where have all the "we're going below 10k" people gone?
!!comment!!: It’s already Monday here.

Back to the fiat mines!
!!comment!!: All this Green on the charts are gonna force me to stay awake and look at the charts whole night.
!!comment!!: As the 49ers season dies, Crypto markets rise
!!comment!!: I wonder if we'll hit $24k before the daily closes. Hmm.. 53 minutes to go!
!!comment!!: Imagine where we would be if it wasn’t for that asshole sbf. Probably well over 32k
!!comment!!: Come on BTC. You can do it boy. Keep pumping.
!!comment!!: The daily is going like in the good old times
!!comment!!: One guy has went from 500 to 1500 tiles in a few hours, with it increasing.  He's minting out everything he can.  How's it going to be with 1 guy owning 30% of the board?
!!comment!!: https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1619507518987964426?t=aK3y3u0C5x2xiyNjuIPHvA&s=19

"Bitcoin has now reclaimed its long-term holder cost basis ($22.3k) in addition to its short-term holder cost basis ($18.9k) and the aggregated cost basis. Behavioral shift as holders in aggregate are no longer underwater. 

The last three times this has happened are shown below:"

Bull run confirmed
!!comment!!: I've never cashed out or converted any of my Coinbase Earns. Foolish? Probably.

But from a starting total of $127 in free crypto, their current value is now just under $55.

This is the only indicator I refer back to regarding the market. Everything else is just noise. 😜
!!comment!!: Hope everybody getting to they peace ✌️ on here 💰
!!comment!!: What kind of server hosting package do you need to keep Moonplace website running for a full 30 minutes uninterrupted? 🤓
!!comment!!: it’s nice to see eth finally stretching its legs
!!comment!!: People had MONTHS to buy cheaper BTC, but they waited for a 50% rally to start buying because they wanted to buy at 12k. That’s why time in the market beats timing the market
!!comment!!: Holy shit, bears are fucked
!!comment!!: /r/buttcoin is on suicide watch
!!comment!!: Good afternoon! 

Looks like crypto is slightly up again today!! Happy. I could get used to this!
!!comment!!: The last bear market really dealt with everyone no project is talking about being the btc killer or Eth killer on twitter again 🤣
!!comment!!: Good morning! Waking up to a 5% up in portfolio feels great
!!comment!!: Excited for the ride ahead this year. Anyone else feeling like it's finally time to buy back into the market in general?
!!comment!!: So much green yet so quiet in here
!!comment!!: 24h volumes up to $71B 

That’s much higher than the crabbing periods last month.

💚
!!comment!!: Entering hour 7 stuck at the airport... I think I've read every crypto article out there right now
!!comment!!: I'm so thankful getting into crypto in the last 4 months. Seeing hopefully the end of this bear and I  know to take profits If the bull returns
!!comment!!: Question for all my 'it's not a bull run' people: if your wife spent 3 weeks getting balled out by her yoga instructor would you call it an affair?
!!comment!!: https://i.imgur.com/7C4Jlzp.jpg

guys wth did you doooo?
!!comment!!: Has anyone seen my top hat and monocle? I need to call Forbes for my interview and I want to look the part
!!comment!!: Hopefully these last few pumps can convince some of our fellow holdouts that quite possibly the bottom has come in, who knows but if the bottom did come in Bitcoin is still cheap right now if it keeps pumping atthis Pace in a couple months it won't be.
!!comment!!: and now 16 cents. Good job team behind MoonSpace!
!!comment!!: Ok I haven’t been on in a long time wth is moonspace
!!comment!!: Come on who is selling 23.3k? Everyone knows 25bp and less hawkish talk is coming next week. Do not let the cramer win.
!!comment!!: Well that pump was extremely short lived
!!comment!!: Don’t you get penalized for selling moons as in your earning ratio drops?
!!comment!!: Do you guys ever buy directly from trust wallet? Or do you guys go through your regular ways to buy it
!!comment!!: Only 6% unique holders of MoonPlace... A big yikes if your holding these as a speculative investment imo.
!!comment!!: Would it be smart to pay some out now to fund my sidehustle? I’m in profit, so I would only take the profit part.
!!comment!!: So many items to collect from r/cryptocurrency - moons NFTs and now tiles. Too late to jump on the MoonPlace bandwagon but congrats to everyone who got a tile or two (and then some)!
!!comment!!: Well I hope we've really left the bottom behind, because I don't think I can mentally handle another drop to $17k.
!!comment!!: This rally is eerily similar to the 2019 rally where bitcoin went from 3k to 14k before ultimately going back down. Eerily similar.
!!comment!!: So I tried to find a risky moon coin to make some money on with a dumb leverage gamble (for fun, with a little amount of money, I'm not crazy) over the weekend.

I bottled it and just played it safe with MATIC. Only put a small amount in, but still a happy weekend.
!!comment!!: Anyone staking atom? I only have a low amount, not sure its worth it with the 21 day hold.
!!comment!!: We need to clear these sell walls up to 24k before we can teleport to 30k
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: I am most certainly NOT in the bathtub!
!!comment!!: So it's pump - crab for a week - pump again. Liking this new BTC trend
!!comment!!: To prop up the ponzi, FTX literally dumped millions of stolen tokens on other people liquidating them out of everything they own and I'm seeing some "this rally is price manipulation" on my timeline

The bullshit was the dump, not the rally
!!comment!!: Is it easy to stake your assets on kraken ?
!!comment!!: What is the cheapest exchange to go from crypto to fiat in your bank? So many fees along the way. In US btw
!!comment!!: Crypto is back??? Or fake run?
!!comment!!: Coinbase learning isn't active in my country anymore, it makes me sad.
!!comment!!: It’s not looking good for the 49ers. 

But it is looking good for Bitcoiners.
!!comment!!: Reddit app was giving me trouble staying logged in. I just nervously Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and successfully recovered my moon vault. Whew!
!!comment!!: Might have to start DCAing more (fomo)
!!comment!!: Almost done with January its been a good month and new year for crypto so far
!!comment!!: Any interesting nft collections worth to get familiar with?
!!comment!!: Remember guys, the most important smart contract is you.
!!comment!!: All this DCAing is paying off 😭
!!comment!!: I was waiting to buy even lower, so this is probably actually a legit start to a bull run since that's how life works.
!!comment!!: At this rate, Moons are gonna get more mentions in the daily than BTC.
!!comment!!: Wonder if i made the right choice to spend all 600+ MOONS i acquired in a year on moonplace… 😅
!!comment!!: anyone here still invest in atom? I did some dca down over the last year wondering if others still invest in it?
!!comment!!: What a fucking journey. I got into crypto in Feb 2021 when BTC was pushing for 60k for the first time and had been buying ever since. My portfolio was -50% in the red at one point. I continued buying through 2022, and bought even more under 18k. I'm now only -5% in the red as of now. I don't know if things will get bad again, but feels good to know I can keep calm and DCA if it comes to that.
!!comment!!: Sol has been so strong since its bottom below 10
!!comment!!: 70 percent on my exam. I’ll take it.
!!comment!!: Is Litecoins ATH really $420.69?
!!comment!!: I still don’t trust this pump, the PTSD from 2022 is strong
!!comment!!: Holy shit - we need an anti-ChatGPT filter. This sub is infiltrated!!
!!comment!!: Just happy to see moons going up, won't sell till $10 though
!!comment!!: btc has been resilient against really any re-trace thus far. a lot different than any other time it's pumped during this bear market. obviously anything can happen but this is as bullish as i've been since last november
!!comment!!: Never before have I agonized for hours over how to draw a 50x50 pixel Snorlax so as to not shame my neighbour u/Maleficent_Plankton on Moonplace.

His owl... whatever, thing, looks awesome in the top left.  Crossing my fingers that my boy looks good.
!!comment!!: It’s pumping time🎉 the money the bulls made off decimating bears options yesterday is being put to work now💪
!!comment!!: All aboard!

!!comment!!: The famous "head rolling down the stairs" pattern
!!comment!!: To all the bears who shorted RIP and lol
!!comment!!: People that think this isn't the end of the bear market should really open their eyes and check out the volume

&#x200B;

The other day we hit as much volume on coinbase as when we were breaking 60k
!!comment!!: Wow, what a freaking day! Broke 6k moons and now I'm in the green with CKB. Epic day.

Still a ways to to until I’m even. My average buy is around $31K

!!comment!!: Couple things to remember

-Cant be green forever. Correction days are normal

-No one knows what is going to happen and if they claim to they're full of shit 

Have a nice day fellow crypto bros
!!comment!!: How will I ever teach my future kids/grandkids the value of honest hard work? They will ask me how I got rich, telling them taking a shit while shitposting won't help much...
!!comment!!: One more moon distro and my moons will pass up my ATOM stack in terms of USD

!!comment!!: January 25th already? Shesh lol. At least crypto price action has been decent last few weeks.
!!comment!!: Finally able too buy something, shit I almost lost 300 bucks if I would have bought 3 hrs ago, ty for working in my favor for once.
Even though my folio just took a shit atleast most alts, but that's expected.Andbwebstart again.

Key ideas from “Inventing Bitcoin”

- Bitcoin is poised to decentralise the production and consumption of money
- Bitcoin is the first digital system which enforces scarcity without any intermediaries and is the first asset known to mankind whose unchangeable supply and schedule of issuance is known completely in advance 
- The mass media often portrays an image of Bitcoin miners solving complex mathematical equations. That is a fallacy. What they do is to repeatedly roll a giant virtual die to produce a hash within a certain target interval.

Sometimes, stacking sats is a lonesome process, and you may lose sight of your original resolve. Reading “Inventing Bitcoin” for some inspiration. Hope you are recharged as well.
!!comment!!: It's moon day. Even though I've done nothing but hold every moon I've earned and will do nothing different, exciting day
!!comment!!: Gonna have crab for lunch today
!!comment!!: Can I pls get a quick 100x bagger before this whole market collapses?
!!comment!!: My Dad died on 1/2 and it really affected my daily shitposting this month. Lowest moon count since distros started.
!!comment!!: please no one move, dont scare CKB pump. Its a shy one
!!comment!!: I really underperformed this time.
I knew I should have cancelled life in order to get more moons.
Not gonna happen again. 
Breathing should be the only activity allowed apart from moon farming.
!!comment!!: Alright, enough posting. I really need to get back to this math trigonometry homework. See y’all in 5 mins
!!comment!!: New moons look pretty good on you all 🤩
!!comment!!: Wow that’s quite the green candle
!!comment!!: I am honestly beginning to think it might be a bull, which probably means everything is about to crash lol
!!comment!!: Bogdanoff : \*heavy breathing\*
!!comment!!: Inverse Cramer comes through again
!!comment!!: I came back seeing BTC still a little below $23k. Read the comments here, actually opened the chart and saw it actually jumped to almost $24k.

The action always happens when I'm away 😭
!!comment!!: I got just over 3 moons.  No one has more moons than me.  I have the most moons. The best moons.  Everyone knows that.  They look at me and they say, "Now that guy knows moons."
!!comment!!: So far quitting cigarettes about 2 years ago allowed me to buy 1.5ETH with money that would be wasted. I keep it in my wallet and watch it grow every week, .01ETH = 1 pack of smokes
!!comment!!: Being active here is like DCAing, when the bullrun comes, it will be wonderful for moon holders.
!!comment!!: buy more bitcoin everyone and pump it over 25k for me
!!comment!!: I bought BTC yesterday on my birthday, everything’s falling into place…
!!comment!!: Is it me or do Coinbase fees suck? €3.84 fee on €100 purchase. Seems to be fixed regardless of what currency. 

Anyone suggest a cheaper alternative? (Based in Ireland)
!!comment!!: How often can the [**S&P 500 reject from the same damn trendline since all time high**](https://i.postimg.cc/fybkbP2J/S-P500-Trend.jpg)? Crypto would have such a wonderful pump if we go above that one. So many people in the financial world are watching it.
!!comment!!: I hope you all have a great Moon day 😁
!!comment!!: Whatever happens, prepare your cheeks
!!comment!!: I love when big moves happen in the market and the daily is alive. Pretty dead recently
!!comment!!: Did my DCA today, quite happy about it, let's see where market goes..
!!comment!!: We were so close to that 1/1 moon/karma ratio. Wonder if we'll hit it next month
!!comment!!: Sweet, finally broke 1,000 moons. 🌝
!!comment!!: Had a dream I woke up and BTC was just flying away. Watched it hit $188k before I threw my phone at the wall knowing my short had just been obliterated.

Woke up. Still crabbing around 23k 😮‍💨
!!comment!!: Let’s see that moon count.. praying for over 5k…
!!comment!!: Had my first distro, super happy
!!comment!!: Want to know why the avatars will make it? 

A person was hacked, and lost her favorite avatar…. The artist bought it back and gave it back to her because he knew how much it meant to her…

Yeah. That happened.
!!comment!!: This is a Tobias Fünke market
!!comment!!: Look how happy everyone is today. Hope to see a good ratio again next time!!
!!comment!!: 37 moons this round, move outta the way peasants

![gif](giphy|feprbmA9EksPvqMcMS|downsized)
!!comment!!: Looks like we might hit 24k today
!!comment!!: It doesn't matter how high it will go if you can't time the local top. What matters is how hard it will correct after and where the next support will be
!!comment!!: First time here in at least a year I'd say. Bitty seems to be in the move.
!!comment!!: Wish  everyone all the big green candles/dildos they are hoping for,. Not because I care about all you lovely people, but if you are getting them, I am also getting them.

You can call me a prick, but hey at least  I am a  honest prick.
!!comment!!: at this rate market will recover by the time I get my tax money back lol so much for buying the dip with tax returns
!!comment!!: Was working on my Jeep to save vs dealership for crypto...first look since 4 hrs ago...nice!
!!comment!!: Well that was short lived :/
!!comment!!: Congratulations everyone on the new moons 🌕🌕🌕
!!comment!!: I’m in for the tech again
!!comment!!: Do you think in a few years we will scroll through this sub and wondering how dumb we are for not accumulating more at this price ?
!!comment!!: I feel there is nothing to be afraid of. A lot of long term indicators point at long term trend reversal, on top of the fact that nearly every bear market so far has in bitcoin has ended in roughly 400-450 days. There will be resistance on the way up, but bitcoin getting to 30k levels is inevitable. There's a bunch of shorts going to get liquidated up there.
!!comment!!: hahaha, u/XnoonefromnowhereX promised me 10 moons if I could show him an article painting crypto in a positive light. when I did, he first wrote [this](https://imgur.com/a/l6p2wo7) (it's not even paywalled, lol) and then blocked me before I could answer anything. cool dude, lol
!!comment!!: I was wondering why the Daily was sorted by best, turns out I was on the wrong daily. Dammit Im getting more stupid by the minute

*This shitpost was based on style of u/cryotosensei*

!!comment!!: Moons are about to be released. The final ratio is 0.93275.

Congratulations to everyone! Hope you are happy with your Moons.
!!comment!!: Rip in peace all the people that didn’t buy low because they wanted 12k. Y’all be remembered
!!comment!!: All hail moons! Whens the next distribution??
!!comment!!: I might have done some stupid mistakes in the last 2 years, but at least I never used leverage or shorts/longs
!!comment!!: Grab the chips fellers, we got some dip.
!!comment!!: 3 weeks of green followed by a red candle 3 days in to the week. Time for some pullback perhaps.
!!comment!!: BTC is holding up well.

Alts not so much
!!comment!!: I hope we stay up. I heard the bears "have screenshots to show" if we get back to 16k. 0\_0
!!comment!!: Hot web 3 gaming take, there is nothing that NFT’s/blockchain can do for gaming that doesn’t already exist in the industry or can’t be made possible by the tools that game devs already have. 

CSGO has a P2P economy that apparently isn’t possible without a verifiable blockchain lol. Many other games have this as well.

Play 2 Earn is a recipe for disaster in the age of bots and spam accounts.

Not to mention how play to earn games are either copy cats of already successful games, or simply not fun to play.
!!comment!!: Looks like Europes waking up and pulling us slowly back up. Well done guys keep it up.
!!comment!!: DXY is dangerously close to 100, and can try to do a bounce in their support if the fed brings a bit of joy to the USD the next week.
!!comment!!: Good morning folks, looking forward to 🌝 distribution.
!!comment!!: Last time we had this same price action before we went a leg up,
!!comment!!: We going to 25k Bitcoin soon?
!!comment!!: Bears back to your cage... or your: Your position has been liquidated 🤫🤭
!!comment!!: USA. Taxes. If I made less than 600 USD on each crypto website, will I not get any 1099 INT? Or will I just not get a 1099 INT at all anyway? 

How does this work? Should I get some kind of crypto tax software?
!!comment!!: I made my bets in the prediction tournament. In the title it's written that there are a lot of prizes like moons, avatars and so on. However I can't find any page with the rules.

I just noticed that I ended up in the 10th position out of more than 6,5k users. That's quite impressive considering it was my first try. I already know that I'll never be so lucky again, so will I get any prize this time or the leaderboard means nothing?
!!comment!!: Good morning from the Uk, may your morning be warmed up by lots of green candles

!!comment!!: I sacrificed a snek for the daily, now we'll be blessed
!!comment!!: One of my recent posts got cross posted to buttcoin and they made fun of me. I feel honored
!!comment!!: Here's an honest opinion, This past month has been a breath of fresh air, at the end of the last run in Dec I cashed out 80% of my portfolio, and staked the other 10% And put 10% into stables.In time this created a -70% hole.In that time from June too now I've managed too get that to -39%.Yesterday I said too myself let's see if it will level out redeemed all my staking rewards, Rose, atom,tezos,osmosis, kusama, Moonriver,and cro.The eth is still sitting where it was 2 years ago.During this rally I've been able too break even.No more 18k hole.Taxres are fucked already but well worth it in my opinion.Toi my fellow patrons I say congrats, even if we go back down too 20, or 19.I think it's safe too say that unless if we get a Mt Gox type event I think we cleared the hump!!!
!!comment!!: All the AI coins are pumping again. Did anyone buy some on the dip?
!!comment!!: I'm convinced people come here friday night to drunk shit post
!!comment!!: The last couple weekends had pumps, but I think we just crab this time. BTC is out of Viagra at the moment and is trying to get more.
!!comment!!: Shib about to start the 2023 bull run LFG!!
!!comment!!: Seeing moons outperform every top 100 coin in 24 hour gain % is exciting.

!!comment!!: Dropping 1k into btc today. Who matching me
!!comment!!: Afternoon, fellas.

I'm new and I'm kind of brain storming how I want to partition my portfolio.  I know about half should be in BTC/ETH... check.  I'm also going to do 15 or 20% MATIC, but I also want 25% of my portfolio to be alt coins with more runway.  I'm NOT necessarily asking for advice on specific coins so much as "sectors" that are worth considering... For example, I want to have at least one WEB3 coin and at least one DeFi coin.

Other than WEB3 and DeFi, what are some other "sectors" that might be worth considering?  AI maybe?
!!comment!!: There's only 16 people in the daily right now... And I think that's a buy signal
!!comment!!: Chinese spy balloons are bullish for crypto right?
!!comment!!: The fact that there isn’t a Egg Inu or Chinese Ballon Baby Doge coin tells me the bottom still isn’t in
!!comment!!: Eth will diverge from Btc price action. It is inevitable. The burning mechanism plus high network usage it’s just fundamentally a matter of time.
!!comment!!: Price went up while I was asleep, and started dropping when I woke up....


Back to sleep I go
!!comment!!: ATOM reached $15! Where are all my Cosmonauts at?

!!comment!!: So many moons being burned in the past couple weeks. Gotta love it!!
!!comment!!: Prolly a FAQ sorry. But if I never moved my moons outta the vault ever, are they burned in this nova thing? Or were they automatically bridged?
!!comment!!: I miss talking about random crypto related things in this sub. The last 2 months have been super stressful work wise. It's good to be back you degenerates!

!!comment!!: ~~1 more day until the next bull run!~~

day 1 of the bull run! xD
!!comment!!: It's nice seeing all the buying I did in the past 6 months "pay off" (on paper) but I'm definitely not ready for things to pop off too hard. I was hoping to keep buying cheap...it's still cheap, but I mean...I'm just not ready.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Considering all the bullshit that's gone down in the past year (and keeps going, now with Genesis, etc.) the fact that the market is where it;s at right now is pretty remarkable. I don't understand it at all, but it's encouraging! 

Bull trap or no, the fact that a bull trap could even be pulled off in this time is saying something about the relisiency of Bitcoin.
!!comment!!: I am glad to announce my portfolio is up 29.35% all time

!!comment!!: Atom is carrying my portfolio! Thanks, Atom you’re a swell guy
!!comment!!: I have to say, watching this sub experience disbelief during this rally after months of shouting "BuT tHe MaCrO" is incredibly entertaining. Even went back to read some old comments like [this one](https://preview.redd.it/ixl5pyqjq43a1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d67db1752ca38ee9e247da13d2f281e15fa9f27). 

Note that $24.5K is likely hard resistance. That is where the 200 week moving average of Bitcoin lies. We already broke that level on the total market cap though! Which I value more.
!!comment!!: NGL I am an at the disbelief psychology stage haha
!!comment!!: I don't know who need to hear this but prices are still darn low if you want to buy. It is not like you missed out because of the past green days so go crazy.
!!comment!!: Good job BTC. Shun the non believers. Shun!
!!comment!!: I literally sold 50% of my crypto dec 30th, then a few days later a massive ralley starts. I can’t tell you how much this hurts after losing 100% of my crypto to Celsius at the time.
!!comment!!: Became a whole coiner last week, now on to 2!
!!comment!!: Just found out my mom has cancer this morning. 

Never thought I'd have to deal with something like this.

!!comment!!: With this movement, a carton of eggs is back on the menu.
!!comment!!: Even though I bought all I possibly could in the 15-17k range without going completely broke, I still wish I bought more. Worked overtime each week in December, just to buy the dip. And I still wish I bought more.
!!comment!!: My stocks went red but my crypto is green. A win is a win
!!comment!!: So happy, I almost have the energy to do my taxes!
!!comment!!: So if you bought any time in December, you're sitting pretty good right now.

Two and a half months ago I began the reddit moonshots portfolio off a shill post I found on the sub. One project (VRA) is in solid profits (35%). XMR and HBAR are around even. Everything else is at least 20% down

Next halving in 68,435blocks
!!comment!!: 23K looks to good on BTC in 2023.
!!comment!!: I wonder how long it will be before my friends that gave me shit for getting into crypto start texting me “is now a good time to buy?”.  I’m thinking somewhere around $50k-$60k.
!!comment!!: I still have trust issues. Remember when we went from $35k to $47k and then back to $19k? Or from $19k to  $24k and then back to $15k?
!!comment!!: Don’t let sub sentiment dictate what you do. Do what you’re comfortable with.
!!comment!!: *Why is Bitcoin pumping?*

Possible reasons:
1. BTC recovering from FTX fallout
2. Cooling of inflation
3. Short sellers getting obliterated 
4. Supply shock due to exodus of people getting their BTC off exchanges 

and how can we forget?
5. Inverse Cramer principle
!!comment!!: 1. Run sentiment analysis on cryptos mentioned in r/CryptoCurrency
2. Find the top negative sentiment coins
3. Automatically invest in those coins and rebalance weekly
4. Profit
!!comment!!: Im not selling until I hear a non crypto person mention crypto

!!comment!!: I'll admit it, I sold a portion of my crypto bag right at a break even point. Was hoping to buy lower, feels bad but I am sticking to my guns. I'm not fomoing in, even though I feel it in my nutsack. I'll see ya'll at sub 20k or post 100k, just happy I still have skin in the game.

That's when broke plebs will realize they could have doubled their money if they bought the bottom.

I obviously have no idea if the price reaches that level.
!!comment!!: Anyone else super happy with that pump even though the portfolio is still deeply red? 😂
!!comment!!: I no longer like the coins I'm in.   Atom just dropped like 4% in 5 minutes. Tf?

!!comment!!: i’m genuinely surprised by how poorly eth is performing. it can’t seem to hold 1600 for the life of it
!!comment!!: 23k for almost a week, I think it has something to do with it being 2023 now.
!!comment!!: In case anybody cares here’s some analysis where things might go the next week:

Bitcoin is holding very well after the parabolic short squeeze that surprised everyone. Breaking the 200 MA attracted a lot of traders back fueling even more green. Generally the macro economics are looking better which is the main reason for the 2023 green also clearly visible in the stock market. Inflation being under control is priced in, rate hikes priced in and avoiding a full recession let’s the market react very euphoric. Economy is still strong same as consumer confidence even after all the rate hikes & inflation.

The problem: chance for a double inflation cycle. The fed knows cooling down to 4-5% YOY ( CPI is a lagging indicator they are already way closer to their 2% goal ) is not sustainable enough therefore it’s a question how long the rate hikes will stay up until they fully pivot. ( 25BPS is somewhat already a pivot )

Fully pivot means fed basically tells the market they’ll weakening the dollar which can temporary fuel all assets but usually only occurred when things already looked really bad ( which is not the case )

25 BPS rate hike will most likely happen ( almost guaranteed ) and the entire market expects it. If they actually out of nowhere hit it with a 50 BPS you can expect a sharp dump of 6-10% on BTC and across all crypto assets on just the news and more next days.

If the fed is hawkish or has hawkish plans after announcing 25 BPS it’s gonna be blood similar to the last announcement.

If they actually sound positive after the 25 BPS announcement it could easily lead to a 25k+ BTC and holding that range
!!comment!!: Let's see for how long moons can stay above $0.1 this time

!!comment!!: Reading up as much as possible about the Shanghai upgrade. Anything else that will shed insight on my feeble notes? 👇



Popular misconceptions regarding Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade 

1. That the proportion of staked ETH will necessarily plunge because people will scramble to unstake their ETH. Knowing that one has the ability to unstake ETH may actually incentivise many investors to continue staking especially since the staking rewards will likely increase after the initial flurry of unstaking.

2. That it will result in a drastic dump in ETH’s price. However, people neglect that the current staked ETH is only slightly more than 13% of its total supply. Even then, a significant proportion of staked ETH (>60%) is actually relatively liquid since it is staked by one of several liquid staking protocols (Lido, Rocket Pool, Stakewise) or exchanges like Coinbase, Binance & Gemini.

3. That gas fees will fall after the upgrade.

!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - January 20, 2023 (GMT+0)

!!comment!!: Today I reached my goal of 3 ETH.  now to keep accumulating as much as I can throughout 2023.
!!comment!!: Some of my Coinbase earns have legit come down to 6 cents, quite a few at .40. Lol depressing
!!comment!!: I wish I wasn't so cynical, feel like the whales are playing games getting ready to dump on our parade.  When there's bad news, but a big pump, that raises the old hackles.  Eh, enjoy today.  We haven't seen the sun in awhile.
!!comment!!: Lol we pump on our way to every FED hike. Like clockwork 😂

The lull between hikes makes whales bored and retail euphoric. How quickly people forget.
!!comment!!: The bulls are back in town
!!comment!!: Not going to lie, I’m actually disgusted by the market right now. I lost 50% of my investment, cashed out and was waiting to get back it. Until now I was very fine with that, just got to be strong mentally. But missing this pump and not even understanding what’s going out is just too much. So unpredictable
!!comment!!: 3$ Learn & Earn on Coinbase!!! Bull run is back!!
!!comment!!: I don’t understand why people are so shocked about people buying FTT

People still buy Terra Classic 

Stupid are going to Stupid

No, I will not scroll out. My ego needs this.
!!comment!!: Daddy corn wants that 22.5
!!comment!!: Well it's been a good day, thanks too a timely pump I was able too finish off my bags of Alts and be done with them, Now it's time for strictly ethereum till we take off, I've held btc since 2017 it just sits where it is and every once and awhile I sell some and buy back in a year later.Hope every one else is playing this smart, remember that globally we are still in deep shit.But sentiment has changed for the positive it seems,  keep in mind our outlook could always change on a dime.
!!comment!!: Tip for Newcomers:

Always leave two Pornhubs tabs open in case someone drops into your room while you are trading shitcoins.
!!comment!!: Reading a book on workplace productivity now and introduced to the Bowling Ball Principle. Though this is something I don’t have to think about because whenever I have in-between time, I come to shitpost here!

need another 66% to break even
!!comment!!: Coinbase app is acting up again. Can’t see my assets.

!!comment!!: It’s the seven sneks.  Has to be
!!comment!!: If ETH breaks $2k today I’m a ball out and buy the family a whole bucket of KFC
!!comment!!: Skipped buying more because I thought we’d go lower 😬🔫
!!comment!!: Good old days when you could buy any meme on BSC thay was already up 1000% and it would run at least 3x more


You could buy launchpad shit on Binance that was already up for the day and it would still run lile crazy



We would all argue like maniacs that MY BAGS are better than YOUR BAGS, but it was all the time. All of them would pump 40% daily. And all of them are now 90% down from ATH.


God I miss the bull run
!!comment!!: Liquidate the non believers! (/s)
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: I hope eth can hit 10 to 15k by 2025.

!!comment!!: Remember to get your shit off CEXs, let's not get stupid again so soon.
!!comment!!: Just hit even thanks to dca, now to keep holding.

!!comment!!: Hopium is back on the menu, boys.
!!comment!!: Oh wow… are we going to test 23k if we can rip that 🩹 off right now 🤩

!!comment!!: My predictions for this tournament were WAY off. 

Lost 100 tokens
!!comment!!: Well that was a fairly nice recovery considering how much red there was this morning
!!comment!!: Good afternoon daily friends - it's 2 pm Friday afternoon here in Australia, and I'm right in the middle of fiat mining right now -  looking forward to finishing up and starting the weekend - it's been a long day and a long week.

Hope you are all having a great day and will catch you all later!
!!comment!!: Anyone else here remember the crappy online bitcoin casinos back in like 2013/2014? Anyone else regret their decisions? Lol

Would be a crypto classic

!!comment!!: if you dca, the price doesnt matter
!!comment!!: I literally have not had enough time to accumulate…
!!comment!!: Damn the fomo is too real rn. Was 15.4 really the bottom? 😭
!!comment!!: Bitcoin Marketcap: 420 Billion
!!comment!!: HBAR is shooting up like nothing else
!!comment!!: I'm curious if these various exchange bankruptcies are helping to effectively create a short squeeze.  Once these companies file, their assets are effectively frozen thereby limiting the supply on the market.
!!comment!!: The buttcoiners sub is in disarray right now. They don't understand WTF is going on 'oh man buttcoin should be dead man, how can this sub be sooooooooo wrong'

Had a plan and stuck to it👌🏼
!!comment!!: Woke up to BTC $23,173

!!comment!!: Shill me what to buy on top to get rid of all this money ....
!!comment!!: Who else just saw the Moonplace post? Wow. Don't want to sound like an admin-simp but they're definitely pushing the Moons ecosystem forward 👌
!!comment!!: That intel earnings report basically started the financial apocalypse
!!comment!!: BTC down 1%. Bullrun is over guys time to eat ramen again

!!comment!!: Every piece of mainstream financial news out there is preaching doom and bitcoin is ded again. The green in my crypto portfolio confirms it’s all bs tho lol. Keep hodling fellow degens!
!!comment!!: Boring week, weekend better be pumpy 🙃
!!comment!!: Someone please help me understand bitcoin. Preferably someone who knows economics well, unlike myself. 

When you ask the question why Bitcoin is worth anything the answer is supply and demand. I understand the supply part: it’s limited so if it was in demand, then based on supply/demand economics its value would increase. 

But why is there demand for it? I mean consider goat fart. Its supply is limited but it has absolutely no value. Even if there was one goat on the planet that could fart, it wouldn’t increase the value of goat fart because it’s goat fart. In fact people may celebrate the death of such a goat because after that all goats on the planet will be non farting goats. 

What is the difference between goat fart and bitcoin?
!!comment!!: What's the plan today boys

!!comment!!: Btc just needs to hold 23k for another 5 minutes and the bears options will expire worthless🥶

!!comment!!: Hello.

I've been scammed.

Out of a lot of money.

Where is the best place for me to share my story as to spread awareness and teach others from my mistake?
!!comment!!: Some people in r/Buttcoin are proud to be anti-crypto for 8+ years. Imagine dedicating almost a decade of your life hating something. Also imagine the amount of money they would have made if they bought 8 years ago
!!comment!!: Bravery favours the fortunate

!!comment!!: Fellow crypto enthusiast, how’s it going? Any news to catch up on?
!!comment!!: Are we buying this dip ladies and gentlemen
!!comment!!: sorry guys, mt cat walking on my keyboard again
!!comment!!: Can someone help me understand?  Folks seem happy that this Moonplace NFT thingy will burn Moons.  If Moons have unlimited supply, how does burning  Moons benefit anything?  Can’t more Moons just be created?

Flair CSS: Nothing..  


But apparently it didnt work this time. Didnt get a response.
!!comment!!: Does anybody know how to check the options expiring today? I know that they’re supposed to expire 2 pm utc but I wanted to see if most are shorts or longs and am unsure how to or if it’s even possible
!!comment!!: Goodnight all from Australia ❤️💚❤️💚 im wondering whether ill wake up to pumps or dumps. Im sure ill find out from here before i check prices ☺️
!!comment!!: Accumulating a fair amount while Bitcoin pretends to be a stable coin, hopefully it won't bite my ass dumping right after
!!comment!!: Not a single week without drama in the atom ecosystem ⚛️. This week, allnodes and a bunch of validators compromised. Fellow cosmonauts, stay on alert and check where do you ve your stuff staked to prevent jailings etc.

This can also affect to a huge number of Eth and avax nodes with relation to allnodes

!!comment!!: I guess I feel honored but I just got my first legitimate attempt at someone trying to scam me. Received an email invoice from Paypal stating "coinbase updated your invoice paypal"

Guess we’re heading to 25k now.
!!comment!!: MATIC just doesn’t care anymore. If it wants to run it’s gonna run
!!comment!!: Tried trading crypto using minimal leverage. Ain't no way people do this for a living without getting heart attacks.
!!comment!!: Lovely weekend. BTC should get to 25k by Monday.
!!comment!!: I‘ll never understand people with longs/shorts or leverage in an incredible uncertain market.

When we are back in a bull market, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it rip to new highs.

!!comment!!: At least we‘re not in the pump and dump and NFT phase of the market again yet.
!!comment!!: It’s weird. CRO has tanked so incredibly much… that I’ve now been able to earn 25% of what my initial stake was for the debit card, in additional CRO rewards due to cash back from spending. It’s exciting to have that much more CRO compared to what I had originally (at 40 cents.) But also extremely depressing at the same time since it’s only worth a fraction of what I paid for it.
!!comment!!: goodmorning ya all !!!! happy hunting and massive gains 2 all of you
!!comment!!: Great News 🙌

!!comment!!: Gotta love crypto.  USD that was a $BLK share this morning, was converted into XLM in Robinhood and instantly transferred to Coinbase to sit on some limit orders incase we pull back more.

Alternatively, I could have sent the USD to my bank, waited 3-5 business days.  Meanwhile, give Plaid all of my usernames and passwords so Coinbase can know what stores I shop at.  If my history is insufficient, I have to wait 5-7 more days to wait for the funds to clear.

5 minutes vs 2 weeks.
!!comment!!: Whats the general consensus here on ATOM? Researching it currently and liking what im seeing. Just looking for others opinions on stuff i may be overlooking.
!!comment!!: The whales found the sell button again. I thought they wouldn't look behind the "BTC 100k" hats I ordered in 2021.

!!comment!!: Well. That's worse than crabbing.

Who already knows what they’re going to put on theirs?

!!comment!!: I believe that schools should teach students about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is increasingly widely used by companies, so having it provides one more payment option for our youths. For example, Lightning Network wallets like Muun and Blue empower people to buy food and beverages. As such, being knowledgeable about Bitcoin will give our students a leg up in the world.

Had to teach my students the PEEL approach and wrote this as an exemplary 👆🏽I love integrating BTC into my job!

!!comment!!: Lots of hacks out there... stay safe amigos.

\- Keep as little on a software wallet as you can, the rest keep on a hardware wallet using a separate address. Transfer from hardware wallet to software wallet as needed  
\-  check every URL. Always check the part closest to the .com or TLD ([foo.uniswap.com](https://foo.uniswap.com) belongs to uniswap for example. uniswap.foo.com does not belong to uniswap). This is really the biggest preventions  
\- Read every transaction and don't do anything if you aren't sure. Some modern wallets (like coinbase wallet) and extensions (like fire) can help tell you exactly the transaction you are making or what you are signing.  
\- Never trust DMs, discord messages, etc... You never have to give out your seed phrase for any reason.  
\- Be careful clicking through anything in an email. It's good practice to manually go to the website yourself if you need to log in for something provided by the email.

Do this and you are 99.99999% safe from hackers, have fun out there but head on a swivel!

!!comment!!: I got a notification that I got mentioned in a subreddit and went to it; it was set to private.  I take it this was some spam bullshit.  I didn't read the title very carefully.  I just remembered seeing 1-800-Get-Bent, anyone here have that name lmao?

!!comment!!: i swear that crypto is saving third world countries in our case 7th world country Lebanon no joke
!!comment!!: BTC really doesn’t want to be too far from 23k right now. Someone should tell him it’s ok to see other people… like 30k.
!!comment!!: What will be the implications of the next bull run? I hope some hodlers and DCA'ers with thicc bagz about to have their dreams come true; projects come to life; debts are paid off; people are paid back. What will you do with your newfound freedoms?
!!comment!!: We will go higher than 23k the moment one you sells. I'm willing for one of you to make that sacrifice.

!!comment!!: I kinda agree with the bulltrap talk here, but if I sell now to rebuy later I'm pretty sure it will keep climbing, I'll FOMO back in two months at like 31k, only to watch it fall to 15k a week later. I did that shit too many times I'll just hold now.

Managed to be in 14th place, close no cigar, so I was close to be number 1 at losing, can I still call that winning😂😂
!!comment!!: I came 736 in the predictions. How did you all do?
!!comment!!: Oh well. It was fun being slightly less poor for a few days
!!comment!!: I think most people expected a little pullback. The age old question still remains: bear trap or trend reversal? Too early to tell
!!comment!!: Im a little confused about all the panic? We haven't gone down a whole lot considering how much we've gone up these past two weeks
!!comment!!: A small dip after a huge pump…

Everybody: Bear market is back!!!

!!comment!!: I knew that Coingecko premium existed - but it's $50 a month? For, like, a few exclusive articles and stuff? Wtf, I wonder if they have a single premium user
!!comment!!: Thanks to the recent BTC pump, i learnt two more terms in context: breakthrough & bull trap. I guess we don’t have to care about which is which though. Just Keep Stacking
!!comment!!: Futures quickly took a turn the other way
!!comment!!: When you staked ETH using binance, you got a wrapped ETH in the form of bETH at a 1:1 ratio.

What happens after Shanghai?  Assuming you want to unstake, do you still have to swap your bETH back to ETH, and if so, will it be at a 1:1 ratio (the current bETH/ETH price is 0.9816)?  


Say you staked 1ETH, will I get back 1ETH plus staking rewards or will I get back 0.9816ETH plus staking rewards? Or will the price of bETH/ETH become 1.0?
!!comment!!: There are 6 million users, but only 6,6K people only. Why so few?
!!comment!!: Little drop to finally beat 23k tonight?
!!comment!!: Thanks for the comment here. Realized I needed to vote for the moons
!!comment!!: Buy Meta - Jim Cramer. Rip Facebook 😆

!!comment!!: Nothing like a friendly little market wide dump to get the morning started
!!comment!!: Man I wish tournament points were actually Moons
!!comment!!: What‘s that, a dip for ants?
!!comment!!:  I knew I shouldn't make my 5$ DCA...
!!comment!!: don't worry, this is just a higher low forming. $28k soon
!!comment!!: Cramer just said stay away from crypto and stick to gold. Buying one btc rn lol
!!comment!!: Am I the only one that is f**king annoyed by u/croa81 ? Only shitposting, posing and harassing people. Please take a look at his comment history in his profile. How is something like that allowed? Reported him like 10 Times and hope you do the same because I don’t feel someone like him is good for this community or should participate in r/Cryptocurrency
!!comment!!: GUYS, LOOPRING IS ON THE MOVE
!!comment!!: Got a nice $3 raise at work. Which means I can breathe a little easier these days and increase my DCA just a little bit each month

!!comment!!: The ongoing pump is really just a mirror of the stock market recovery.

Global stocks have gained $3.3tn in mkt cap this week thanks to growing evidence of soft landing/mild recession economic scenario, characterized by cooling inflation, non-recessionary growth, & reduced monetary tightening overhang. All stocks now worth $103tn, equal to 106% of US global GDP.

The stock market is on its own pump which cryptocurrency, Bitcoin seems to be still very much linked to. 

Will we ever see different cycles or are the markets all pegged together now.

That said, congrats to anyone who recently bought SOL or AXS!

!!comment!!: So I fucked up somewhere/somehow.

Every month I buy btc and eth, Last night I bought and transfer them to my trezor, I have whitelisted the adresses. My eth comes through after a few mins, but my btc is still not there. I received confirmation of the withdrawl from CDC, but nothing in my trezor. I see now that the adress I whitelisted and the receive adress are different, even though I have used the exact same before.

So where did the money go and what do I do?

edit: it showed up!

!!comment!!: Feels good to be back on green folio
!!comment!!: People say that Bitcoin is a risky investment, but I can't think of a single fundamental reason why it would be risky at this stage. 

China was a huge holder of Bitcoin and the mining hub of the world, yet when they banned Bitcoin, it did next to nothing to the network. 

Maybe Bitcoin was risky when had a sub $1 billion marketcap, but I just can't see how it would collapse at this point.

!!comment!!: Alright Bitcoin, that was a funny joke, but seriously, it’s about time to go back to 25k
!!comment!!: Next Bitcoin halving in about 429 Days and 13 Hours.

!!comment!!: With the price pumping after the bear market its crazy how quick the "experts" come out of the woodwork shilling their 10x guaranteed moonshot.
!!comment!!: I wonder what happened earlier today. the prices of coins shot up and then dumped them rose up again (to a smaller degree) all in the course of 20 minutes. I guess the random volatility is back
!!comment!!: I only need my portfolio to 5x from here to be whole again after some tough breaks and honestly it seems doable for the first time in a long time

Nice.
!!comment!!: I have a few Sneks to hand out. Tell me the last coin you bought
!!comment!!: If your feeling FOMO and thinking this isn’t a good time to buy after such a massive pump across the board. 

Zoom out, check the monthly chart. Granted, it’s not as good as it would have been two weeks ago, It’s still a much better time to buy, than when BTC was at $60k after pumping for two years.

Perspective!
!!comment!!: As long as you made at least one large buy between 15.5 and 17.5k that’s a win in my book

!!comment!!: No matter what happens after, it is always joyful to see that crypto is still doing good
!!comment!!: You guys ever think about how funny it is we have daily chats for crypto and stocks? It’s like if we had a subreddit where we all talk about the weather and what it’s gonna be like tomorrow and next year and what kind of clothes we need to buy.
!!comment!!: C/D: The bull run is back.
!!comment!!: So far so good holding 21K range
!!comment!!: Happy to see some green days
!!comment!!: Good thing about crypto is it’s even open on MLK day
!!comment!!: My avg for Eth is now sub 2k… thank you DCA. We will see if this pays off
!!comment!!: Dude.....Coinbase took off the average price per a token so now we are back to doing math like peasants. 

First songbird.....now delayed flare.....now I godda do maths?

Relist XRP.
!!comment!!: Waiting for BTC to pump to $21.5K so I can take profits from daytrading
!!comment!!: I finally mustered up the courage to go see buttcoin today. You know, to see the other sides arguments… It really is just a bunch of people who got wrecked because of their paper hands and are still angry about their choices. Someone should keep an eye on those people. I feel sorry for them.
!!comment!!: I don’t talk about crypto with people and this is a good reason why. 

Guy at work (dudes unhinged) was saying his buddy told him to invest in bitcoin, and he lost 18k and now wants to kill him.
!!comment!!: Bears cant even fathom another 15% move, let alone a true bear market rally. Bears are truly sick creatures that will give back all of their profits per usual
!!comment!!: My portfolio is up 3% after I DCA‘d for 6 month. Is this financial independence?
!!comment!!: Markets barely green but crypto hella green. Love to c it 😍
!!comment!!: Hey yo captain Jack bring us 22k Bitcoin back
!!comment!!: Who’s still here from November 2017??? What a time.
!!comment!!: FOMO'd into crypto in October '21. I was so happy the first 1,5 months, saw my investment reaching 156%. Then the bear run started. At the lowest, I was at -81,25%.

Luckily I was able to DCA some extra money. That brought me back to -58% of my total investment. With the recent gains, I'm currently sitting at -50%.

If my bag of coins reaches their ATH again, this should bring me to 450%, but I think I will DCA out my initial investment once I reach 200%.

Just wanted to share this, as patience hopefully pays out.
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Just took some profits. Pray for me boys
!!comment!!: Wow another green dildo. All this green seems suspicious.
!!comment!!: wow non-stop pumps now, this all started after Cramer told everybody to get out of crypto.
!!comment!!: BTC volume up ...interesting!
!!comment!!: HOLD IT

HOLD IT

HOOOOOOOLD IT
!!comment!!: Hopium addicts come on back, ole bitty crossed 21k again
!!comment!!: Looks like BTC really wants to start another leg up.
!!comment!!: Come on Atom. Break that 13 usd resistance
!!comment!!:  ONE to ONE... take 2.... xD
!!comment!!: Does anyone know how to earn some free Crypto nowadays besides Moons? 

Coinbase Learn and Earn is dissapointing lately.
!!comment!!: As great George Constanza once said "Everybody's doing something. We'll do nothing." That's my approach for everything, including crypto
!!comment!!: The coins are finding stability right now
!!comment!!: Am I the only one that doesn’t mind a quiet day every now and again? 

We’ve made some big (positive) moves over the last week or two, nothing bad with crabbing for a bit to stabilise for the next potential leg up.
!!comment!!: We're at 21k!!! Another green day
!!comment!!: ATOM is holding the line for the #20 spot
!!comment!!: Feels good over here with some dopium  hitting your brain after all the drama of recent months
!!comment!!: BTC just keeps going up. Amazing.
!!comment!!: And another day where BONK is far away from the entry price of most FOMO buyers. I’m glad I sat this one out.
!!comment!!: So not only holding ground - we’re going up. Hmm.
!!comment!!: This thing needs to shoot up to 30k already
!!comment!!: Bears are acting like a jealous Ex . 
 Shakira please let it go he already moved on , dis tracks ain’t gonna stop BTC breaking 22k
!!comment!!: Are we due a correction at this point? What are your thoughts?
!!comment!!: Mother told me to stop buying months ago. Fortunately for me, she also didn’t raise a quitter. Moral of the story, if you don’t listen to your parents you will make money.
!!comment!!: Snap shot already in 2 days..I'm thinking the ratio will be in the lower .6 region
!!comment!!: WE SHALL NEVER GO DOWN AGAIN!!!
!!comment!!: Is it sad I'm excited to only be down about 26% on my crypto investments right now?
!!comment!!: Working out and watching at these prices gives you an extra boost for sure.
!!comment!!: I did not expect Bitcoin to go up so fast but I am not complaining. I saw people calling for BItcoin at 10k or even lower.
!!comment!!: Why the hell is Binance still having USTC listed while its price is at $0.02 or so. Isn't it time to take that scam off the exchange??
!!comment!!: Me sa jajar binks me thinks the bitcorn pump not over
!!comment!!: What they want:

A pullback to $19K

What they will get:

A giant green dildo
!!comment!!: Damn.  Portfolio is almost break even.  Worked hard to get all my averages down the last year.
!!comment!!: ETH looks to be going towards $1700, glad I bought as much as I can sub 1200
!!comment!!: 21k breached, 23k is the magic number. Above 23.8k and it's likely a pump all the way up to 28k.

Above that, and the bull could be back on.
!!comment!!: Right now Bears are acting like some Arab football team trying to stop Ronaldo from scoring . 

22k here we come
!!comment!!: Bears are the ones increasingly in fear mode now.

I know the feeling, I've been in that position before. When you think the market will dip lower, and wait to buy (like waiting for $14K or $10K), and then instead it suddenly rallies.

Then you expect it's just a fake pump, and it will correct right back, but hours go by, then days. And you start to get nervous.

You hope stocks will dip, or Feds will say something hawkish, CPI will go back up, GDP will go back down, or oil prices will go back above $100. But none of those are happening.

Or you wait for good old "bloody sunday". And nothing happens.

Then you start to really worry that FOMO is setting back in. And maybe even if there is a correction, it's unlikely to dip lower to $14K,  or even a new low, and may not even return to $16K.
!!comment!!: Great and green day to all!
!!comment!!: Well cheers to fiat mining this week lol
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Finally catching a pump live!
!!comment!!: Looks like we’re taking another elevator up
!!comment!!: It seems the 3-day weekend (for many in US) has appeased the market gods

!!comment!!: We did it guys!!! $21k bitcoin unlocked! Shorts got rekt as always
!!comment!!: I named this Jim Cramer bull market
!!comment!!: Just stay above 21K and we’ll be good
!!comment!!: I can't believe $FTT is up 152% over the last 7 days. If crypto wasn't so full of degenerate gamblers, we'd come together as a community at large to destroy the value of coins like that which are literal representations of everything that is wrong with crypto. Needs to be taken out back and shot. Same with $BNB. Same with any exchange token that exists.
!!comment!!: Wow, it really feels like 2021. Please tell me this is real and not an illusion. I don't want to go under 20k again. It feels so good here.
!!comment!!: It feels weird that I can now add eggs to my ramen. It's like I'm a new person, one day I'm eating plain ramen and the next I am adding an egg? Is this what winning feels like? At this rate, I'll be adding kimchi in no time.
!!comment!!: Old man BTC doesn’t give a shit, he’s on the escalator up
!!comment!!: Ah that sweet sweet bear market relief rally! Loving it!
!!comment!!: Damn finally, 1 tril is right around the corner! Let’s go
!!comment!!: Altcoins is how you lose your hair.    
 BTC is how you stop your receding hairline.
!!comment!!: Is the dollar getting weaker?
!!comment!!: Wow looks like it might be the start of another week of green! Have a great day everyone!

!!comment!!: Afternoon all..
How's everyone?
Still green?
!!comment!!: What smart your crystalball say for today?
!!comment!!: How many more nonsensical articles do we need posted in this sub? How is any of the "Bitcoin reached this new price now" considered news or even remotely interesting? "XYZ thinks this and that about that", yey.

Best case they just try to farm clicks.

Worst case they are pushing their agenda and shilling people into fomoing in.

!!comment!!: It's Friday the 13th and $BTC is close to 20K... sus
!!comment!!: If BTC goes to 20k, I'm having a hot dinner tonight
!!comment!!: Bitcoin dominance increasing. Altcoin prices are increasing in dollars, but decreasing against bitcoin. At this point purchasing btc instead of altcoins is a no brainer: not only it's increasing quicker, but also if we go back to the bear, it will fall slower.

Keep safe and stack sats.
!!comment!!: Feeling FOMO? Try my simple trick of having your wife take everything in the divorce, it's working for me!
!!comment!!: Listen, I don’t care if this is a relief rally or the start of the next bull cycle. We haven’t seen a green week in a while and if you’ve been shoveling fuel into the furnace all 2022 this feels nice. You’re allowed to enjoy it.
!!comment!!: I forgot how exciting green days are :')
!!comment!!: I wanted to be a wholecoiner for such a long time but it felt impossible at the peak of the last bull run with crazy prices. Thanks to the long bear market and continued DCA every week, I'm finally the proud owner of 1 DOT.
!!comment!!: We got Bank of America, Black Rock, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo earning reports tomorrow. Let’s see how that turns out.
!!comment!!: Does it finally break the 19000 resistance.
!!comment!!: Peter Schiff is in disbelief again
!!comment!!: Weird to think we were at $20k at October 2022, feels like a lifetime ago
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|bZ4D0YSGb81r4tpbIK|downsized)

!!comment!!: 2nd snek for the daily! 2023 streak going strong so far!
!!comment!!: Good thing I sold at $16k, now I can buy at these better prices
!!comment!!: I’m looking at the charts and all I can think of is how hard Powell is at the thought of smashing people’s hopes and dreams next month
!!comment!!: $180M/$1B shorts wrecked so far 😏
!!comment!!: Getting closer to Burger King money with the move up today. The commercials have my kids hostage until I buy at least 2 Whopper combo meals.
!!comment!!: Bitcoin Marketcap is up 35 Billion in just 3 days... 🫡
!!comment!!: I just made a purchase of cryptocurrency. Send it.
!!comment!!: Love that feeling you’re watching the charts and a beautiful green candle pops up

![gif](giphy|aRRGY0316l5GMK2uZE)
!!comment!!: Is BTC going to test 20k today? 

I’m thinking we might…
!!comment!!: BTC is up almost 20% in 2023!
!!comment!!: Im gone all in.

Problem is that my ALL IN is 200$. Lol
!!comment!!: You guys are so lucky to be here at the start of the bullrun
!!comment!!: I'm finally in the green on my BTC portfolio! Yay!
!!comment!!: I've been gone for a week what did you guys do



keep doing it please
!!comment!!: Let's just all continue this rally hey? No more selling how about that 👀
!!comment!!: I think the BTC FOMO is beginning.
!!comment!!: I am glad to announce my portfolio is up 10% all time
!!comment!!: How high do you guys think Bitcoin will go in it's current run?
!!comment!!: Trying to stay optimistic, but I’m getting flash backs of that rally from $37k to $48k. $19.7k is max fear for me.
!!comment!!: Is it true that a green candle doesn't really mean the beginning of a bullrun?
!!comment!!: Glad it’s the weekend, hopefully more green to come
!!comment!!: No greater feeling than buying right before a massive green candle.
!!comment!!: Shorts are getting absolutely rekt right now on our way to 20K
!!comment!!: Coinbase not working for me either. No balance, no sell button lol.

I know it's probably fine, but hot damn people are gonna freak out. Especially with this current pump.
!!comment!!: Coinbase can’t handle a pump pt. 2
!!comment!!: Thanks to Coinbase I no longer have a portfolio, cheers
!!comment!!: Everyone get in!!! FOMO train is leaving!
!!comment!!: Of course Coinbase is glitching RIGHT as everything is pumping and my balances are not visible and I can't trade anything.

Fucking stupid let us trade damn it!
!!comment!!: Coinbase are masters at picking the absolute worst times to go down or fuck up
!!comment!!: Coinbase glitching for anyone else?
!!comment!!: I have been too hurt by the markets that now i fear the green 😂
!!comment!!: This is the busiest I've seen the daily in ages, we're all gonna make it!
!!comment!!: 100k end of 2021 back on the menu
!!comment!!: Watch your step, there be sneks
!!comment!!: Went to buy some chips to celebrate the bull market start, but damn those big Doritos now cost $8. That’s wack
!!comment!!: Any news on Nexo since yesterday? From what I gather they're still fine for now and folks have been using their services and withdrawing funds without a hitch
!!comment!!: 17K, 18K and this morning I didn't see 19K when I woke up. Time to go back to sleep.
!!comment!!: One week ago ‘nobody’ wanted to know anything about crypto, today I’m already finding bullish publications in Linkedin. Time to sell?
!!comment!!: Researched a bit on Twitter coins leaks: Damn, they're literally copying reddit coins model. Buy coins using fiat and give awards to tweets. I assume, they'd be saleable as well like moons?
!!comment!!: The last time the daily RSI of Bitcoin was this high, was January 2021. An incredibly powerful move.
!!comment!!: Just letting Rocketpool holders know that the token has just touched its ATH vs Ethereum. It might be a good time to swap RPL to Eth. As an almost Eth maxi, I’m thinking about this.
!!comment!!: Too many rocket emojis with all the moonbois coming back from their caves. Time to focus in charting to short and swing until the daily recovers

!!comment!!: Predictions are back! Bullrun is totally back!
!!comment!!: browsing r/butccoin and ngl

I am flabergasted how little they understand this space.
!!comment!!: I don't go all in, I diversify my portfolio to manage risk.
!!comment!!: If we break this 19400 resistance today I might just be fully bullish
!!comment!!:   Of course CB is having technical difficulties, right in the middle of a pump..predictable
!!comment!!: ETH gas getting high again, oh it’s good to be back
!!comment!!: at this rate I will be down only 50% this weekend.
!!comment!!: Didn’t see coinbase had planned maintenance and just shit myself
!!comment!!: BTC is back above where it was in 2017!
!!comment!!: Wonder what will happen after BTC hits 20K.

!!comment!!: Let’s go to $20K BTC

⬆️⬆️⬆️
!!comment!!: I'm almost getting addicted to the charts again

!!comment!!: 16k is such an obvious buy price in hindsight... luckily I picked up a little bit!
!!comment!!: Coinbase fuckin up again good lord
!!comment!!: 🥒💦BTC 21K!! 🚀

Wow, that didn't take long.
!!comment!!: Crazy that we're cheering for 19k 😂
Not long ago we were panicking when it fell under 20k 😵‍💫
!!comment!!: Whenever I see market optimism these days I’m reminded of that scene in Blackadder, where the troops in the trench are celebrating as the guns fall silent, and Darling yells: “We did it lads, we survived The Great War: 1914 - 1917!”

I’m afraid not.
!!comment!!: Exit pump? Not if you're still down 90%! I'll hold these alts to the lambo dealer or the grave.
!!comment!!: BTC up 0.32% in the last 90 days. Bullish!
!!comment!!: God please just let this be a good pump man, for once just let BTC enter it’s discovery mode
!!comment!!: Wow. 

Where was I when BTC broke 19k!? 

This is why you don't stop looking at the charts people.
!!comment!!: Love to see the green vibes here

every year I am very sad weeks leading up to this date, he was a person who loved new technologies and often asked about new concepts electric cars, quantum computers and of course cryptocurrencies. One day I will be like my grandpa when some new virtual reality AI generated world market gets created

Cherish the people you have in your life, time passes fast, time is the enemy
!!comment!!: Guys iam certain the announcement from DOJ will be very very good. I waited for this event for a while.. everything points at crypto becoming mainstream and i think this will be one of the moments for that
!!comment!!: DoJ spooks crypto market only to announce it's going after a 3rd rate exchange? Definitely intentional fud
!!comment!!: This would appear to be the bear trap, within the larger bull trap, within the even larger bear trap 🗿
!!comment!!: Is this bullish? She's basically saying the US are going to start protecting people invested in crypto and cleaning out the space of bad actors to make crypto more safe? Pumpppp ettttttttt
!!comment!!: At DOJ press announcement:  


"Congratulations to the team that took down the #485923 exchange in the world! We are so glad Americans can sleep safe at night knowing that a random tiny exchange in Hong Kong can't steal their funds. I'm glad we caught this while turning a blind eye to much larger exchanges that exploit the common man. Good job team!"
!!comment!!: I for one applaud the DOJ for a master troll
!!comment!!: "Fiat currency", "virtual assets", "cryptocurrency market", "new technology", all I hear from the DOJ is that they see this space as legitimate and thus want to protect it from criminal activity
!!comment!!: I can hold through a bull market and a f*cking bear market but when I bend over to pick up the shampoo in shower I pull a muscle in my lower back 😐
!!comment!!: Today is exactly 3 years since my mother died. I miss her every day  
People, give love to your parents because no one will be here forever

I know this is off topic
!!comment!!: The fact that they are taking steps towards the shit exchanges and scam projects, compared to simply trying to ban crypto at a grander scale is huge imo. They are acknowledging crypto as a whole isn’t going anywhere.
!!comment!!: This is the prime example of "when a meeting could have just been an email"
!!comment!!: Paid off my BTC loan on Coinbase and moved it back to cold storage. Feels good.
!!comment!!: It’s 12:03 and the live isn’t living 

The fuck is this shit
!!comment!!: Is Bitzlado some sort of ice cream?
!!comment!!: She even Sounds pro crypto
!!comment!!: What a joke press conference by DOJ. No one cares about Bitzlato..
!!comment!!: I'll say it again, I find it funny how just a few years ago the headlines were full of mainstream financial analysts proclaiming animal spirits and a strong stock market means America's economy is strong.

Now all you hear from them today is, "Oh, we printed too much money the last 13 years. Too much QE, stock buy backs bad, and tax cuts led to the situation we are in today. We should've never done this! Bad, bad, bad."

If they weren't such paid shills, they would've spoken up back then instead of pump an imaginary market, but now it's too late because things are going to get progressively worse this year. But I'm sure many of them already cashed out their over inflated chips.

Don't ever get sucked in by these fuckers. Fuck em!
!!comment!!: I just sold a good bit. Pump incoming
!!comment!!: PPI data today at 13.00 UTC. 

Probably will dictate pump continuation or a pull back.
!!comment!!: At this rate I'll only be 50% down soon!!!
!!comment!!: Well if anything, at least 2023 is looking more promising than 2022.

!!comment!!: Never heard of bitsllotto
!!comment!!: This US DOJ announcement was a nothing burger IMO.  Don't know this guy or exchange at all but if he was truly a bad actor, glad he's gone.
!!comment!!: While this reveal was quite lame, it was also one of the most level headed descriptions of enforcement within the crytpto space I have ever heard from US LEO's. They identified a bad actor, and removed them as is their job. No getting on a pedestal. Good on them.
!!comment!!: Welp, that could’ve been an email

!!comment!!: If it’s crashing now doesn’t that mean the real pump is coming after the announcement at 5gmt?

Wreck the longs now, get everyone short then wreck the shorts later. Standard merchant bank playbook and you know they’ve already been given a heads up by their former colleagues on government.

All I need is bitcoin to go to $10,000,000 and cardano to reach $100 and I can probably test this out 🙏

!!comment!!: I had a TG scammer hit me up today and asked me to send them *$250,000*  in UST. They promised a million back in 14 days. Ngl I was kind of flattered they thought I had that kind of money 😂
!!comment!!: It’s up to the old investors to teach newer ones not to buy into times like this where Bitcoin dominance is just now beginning to increase to bear market norms. No I’m not talking about anyone who joined in 2021 but those who have been here during previous bear markets.

Just look at what this recent dip did to some altcoins. Bitcoin was only down 2% today and some coins dropped 10%. Can you imagine what will happen to them if we test 19,18, 17k? Suddenly those partnership headlines don’t mean so much because this is all just a game. Trade and let the next fool hold your garbage.

The only reason you should be buying alts right now is to trade them on pumps, but you have people saying they’re not good day traders…what did you do when you saw your coin up 50%? You didn’t sell because greed told you that it’s too early. But greed also caused you to whip out your wallet on a 2% dip.

Don’t throw away your money.

!!comment!!: It’s a rough ride right now, but a small retrace was inevitable given 2 weeks of green! Hang tight friends
!!comment!!: Imagine the joy and amount of humor it would provide if somebody came out with a Cramer Coin that had a supply of 500MM or so, only released 250MM and burned a very small percentage of tokens for every documented wrong call by Cramer.  There would be strict rules for documentation to ensure accuracy and integrity. There would be no use case.  Project would simply be to create the ultimate meme coin to incense a man on the minds of many to see what may happen on TV and provide content for all to enjoy.

Would be great to let me know how to post. Here is my post in full

Title: I traded bitcoin since 2012 and I think the bear market is not over

Since I experienced the 2014 and 2017 bear markets (and a small part of even earlier bitcoinica bear market), this is what I observed:  
The majority of the market participate invested not because they RESUMED confidence after a bear market.  
They do so because they either didn't know the previous bear, or have forgotten about it.  
After Mt Gox and during the 400-day bear market proceeding it, I have not often see an investor buying bitcoin because they think modern CEX are better managed than MtGox, or the fundimental was not harmed by MtGox so they should resume confidence. No - such happens rarely.  
Overwhelmingly, they invest because either never heard of MtGox or have completely forgotten about it. That's why they dared to invest.  
There is a pattern: bull market returned not because bad sentiment "turned" good. It's because bad sentiment is "forgotten", or market participants are too new to have experienced it.  
Now two things prevents new, non-leveraged sustainable force to join the market.  
First, the memory of FTX and other failed projects are too recent. Mt Gox was the leading reason of 2014 bear market, but this bear market started uneventful and lasted a year before FTX collapsed. The bad sentiment is too recent.  
Second, there lack new market participants who have never heared of the prevoius bad stories. Most people who bought Bitcoin in 2016 never heard MtGox during its collaps in 13-14 and most who bought in 2020 never heard Ethereum during its crash in 17-18. Today due to high participation rate, few are oblivious.

!!comment!!: Whenever the market has me down I just chug a Coke Zero and rock out to Trapt’s Headstrong while I think about my ex-wife and all the money I lost 🥰.
!!comment!!: Debt ceiling…..debt ceiling ….debt ceiling……I guess our debt ceiling is different.  Mine has a hard cap and I literally can run out of money.  Depends upon the day, but it’s either encouraging (green days)or discouraging (red days)that leaders don’t understand monetary policy, therefore will never be able to comprehend crypto and finite limits of crypto.

!!comment!!: I dont understand why people are so surprised Bitcoin (and therefore alts) rallied. Bitcoin has never been more correlated to the stock market \[only exception: FTX collapse\].

What has the stock market done? Well:

* Dow Jones retraced almost 70% of the fall since all time high
* S&P 500 retraced almost 40% of the fall since all time high
* Nasdaq has retraced over 60% of the fall since all time high

These facts combined should make it not that surprising that crypto rallies. If anything, we should have done so much earlier, but FTX likely ruined the party. Even the DXY has been dumping hard. Bitcoin ALWAYS rallies when the DXY dumps hard.
!!comment!!: Why is FTX token pumping? Isn’t this a scam exchange? What’s wrong with people?

2-it’s highly difficult to buy back bull traps as the sell wall amount are way higher

!!comment!!: Some very green days upon us. How many of ya actually up right now? Or most of ya still upside down from late '21/early '22? Did you spend the last several months averaging down some or fear keep ya out of the market?
!!comment!!: I think the main theme of the next bull market will be utility
!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - January 8, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: I really enjoyed the 12 seconds BTC was above 17k. I will remember this day for eternity and talk about it to my grand children
!!comment!!: I was looking for a job and then I found a job and heavens know I'm miserable now
!!comment!!: Most of my coins need a 10x pump to recover my initial investment...just wanted to share with someone
!!comment!!: *ETH and BTC +1%*:

![gif](giphy|SaX384PjtDl2U|downsized)
!!comment!!: Seems like a decade ago when I used to wake up to 100% gains on coins. I hope to see those days again.
!!comment!!: How you plan to spend your Sunday ?
!!comment!!: Massive pump from 16940 to 16950!
!!comment!!: Nice. Only -66% on my ADA now!
!!comment!!: The current sentiment from this price action shows how desperate we are for a recovery.  Like finally getting a piece of tail after being locked up for a decade.
!!comment!!: The 100th Sunday of DCA. What an experience it's been
!!comment!!: Just noticed that it’s my 5yr cake day. 

Some advice, avoid shitcoins and buy BTC & ETH.
!!comment!!: Signed a malicious contract and it took all my eth from my wallet. Any way to revoke the transaction?
!!comment!!: ADA showing some life this morning
!!comment!!: Is this my birthday-pump?! Wow! Nice present, thanks.
!!comment!!: Wish u a great sunday folks👌🚀
!!comment!!: Do you all think we see 10k BTC at any point of this bear market?
!!comment!!: Hope you guys had a great start in the year
!!comment!!: OpenSea now supports Arbitrum Nova on their platform! FYI u/tmztmz2
!!comment!!: Bloody Hell.  Why did nobody tell us that AI coins were gonna perform well this year?
!!comment!!: Hello cryptoland, how are we doing today?
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: Nice to see ADA up nearly 20% since the start of 2023!
!!comment!!: Weekend is over for me unfortunately. Another week of grinding in the fiat mines but a bit closer to the next bull run I guess
!!comment!!: I'm gonna through VET out a mention just cause I still love it.
!!comment!!: What a huge pump we're up almost a percent. Time to mortgage the house and go all in. The bull run is back 🚀 🚀
!!comment!!: Cramer signal is realized. This is bull. Prepare for lambo.
!!comment!!: Volume so low I'm gonna need some subtitles
!!comment!!: I'm guessing we crab slowly upwards until the next round of  bad news - DCG/Genesis/Silvergate/layoffs/closures and or rate hikes. I base that on nothing but a guess.
!!comment!!: Beautiful cold breezy but Warm Sunday Morning this is, happy sunday everyone.

 Hope we will see some solid green soon 💚.
!!comment!!: I know it‘s just a drop on the hot stone but at least ADA is showing some strength
!!comment!!: Damn, I wasn’t noticing but ADA is up nearly 15% in last 5 days. Not bad considering everything going on in the market.
!!comment!!: Patiently waiting for more pain.
!!comment!!: Afternoon all.
How's everyone?
!!comment!!: GALA hell yes. I don't want to curse anything but  hoping for a comeback.
!!comment!!: Since everyone thinks this rally will fail, I think we are going to break out. Shorters will get rekt and the cycle will restart
!!comment!!: Looks like we’re heading back to 16.7k again 🦀🦀
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: Slowly taking the stairs up on the BTC 7D chart
!!comment!!: I just hope that people (including me) persist long enough with crypto to see their pains finally pay off and make the suffering worthwhile.
!!comment!!: SAND is pumping. Now I am only 93.5% down on my investment. whoohoo
!!comment!!: Since CPI is this week, and I anticipate a lower number, I went ahead and bought some more BTC. That being said, that buy just put me officially at my bear market goal.
!!comment!!: Boy these candles are greener than Shrek's asshole and im loving it
!!comment!!: It's so crazy to me that when BTC is at an all time high, this sub is booming and people are buying. They were saying "man, you were lucky to buy BTC at <20k"

But when the price is much lower and actually <20k, it's a ghost town and those people aren't buying. Makes no sense lol.

I have friends who wouldn't stop talking about BTC when it was at ATH and they were buying, but now that it's on sale they wont touch it and don't really talk about it. Like wtf, people should be buying right now more than ever. 

I just envision those inflatable flailing arm advertising droids waiving like crazy and it's just me and 5 other dudes lined up to buy.
!!comment!!: Crypto is going to pump up violently imo. If a nuke down were coming it should’ve been catalyzed by bearish ftx/dcg/silvergate news.

All the selling absorbed. Volatility hitting 2018 lows. Just shove your $ in with no leverage and pray imo.
!!comment!!: Hello the new daily! So quiet here!
!!comment!!: We were above 17k for 5 seconds
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|nZW5fIzaIJVXddVla7|downsized)

Just miss posting this guy.

Making sure he’s still ready for the bull run.
!!comment!!: The bull market is back on, lambos and hot pockets back on menu
!!comment!!: Just contribute another Snake for the daily.

May the Snake God wake up and turn the crypto world green 💚
!!comment!!: Have a question for the people with platinum tier and changed their flair how can you do this?
Never got a message with the perks that come with platinum can someone explain what you can do with it and how

Thanks in advance
!!comment!!: Dumb question of the day. How can a crypto price be trending up when the volume is lower?
!!comment!!: Remember how some in this sub were buzzing about Apecoin? Where did they all go?
!!comment!!: where's the best place to keep track of all the dot parachains?
!!comment!!: Somehow i feel the $DOT parachain slot auction was a flop. Opinion?
!!comment!!: (I know it's against reddit TOS) but I want to swap my moons for Nano but now I can't cause I can only send them to other users instead of other wallets like I used to. What do I do
!!comment!!: Weekends used to lead to exciting crypto price action. Now it’s completely flat. I guess retail really is mostly gone
!!comment!!: Apparently, El Salvador's Bitcoin city will be free of income, property, and capital gains taxes. But is this sustainable? Where will it’s revenue come from to cover infrastructure and other gov costs?
!!comment!!: Hi 👋 daily fam. It’s Sunday night and bedtime here in Australia. Back to fiat mining tomorrow. Will be working from home as kids still on holidays. Lots of online meetings. Should have plenty of opportunity to lurk and watch the charts. Take care everyone and have a great week!
!!comment!!: I feel like big movements might come soon , cuz this silence doesn't feel right
!!comment!!: Good Afternoon from a sunny Europe. The crabbing continues, which at least means that my portfolio is substantially worth more compared to some months ago as the DCA doesnt isntantly evaporate lol
!!comment!!: does anyone else think that this sub is a nicer place now all the scams finally imploded and wipped out the moonboys?
!!comment!!: I see ADA is recovering, I knew I shouldn't have given up on it. I will continue holding my bag
!!comment!!: Besides BTC, what else are you all buying right now?
!!comment!!: Dont worry friends.

Everything is going to be alright... *someday*
!!comment!!:  First Sunday of the new year.  Will we see the return of the Bloody Sunday streak?  Or will *this time be different*?
!!comment!!: You might want a lambo, I just want a bunch of cans of beans.
!!comment!!: is it safe to come out guys?
!!comment!!: Yeah we ain’t breaking past that $17k resistance anytime soon .. it’s been unfazed everytime we touch $17k
!!comment!!: We touched 17K for a while, and now back to crabbing just below it for the remainder of the day.
!!comment!!: Volume so flat the last 24 hrs that the couple hundred $ candle looks enormous.
!!comment!!: Is there some problem with Binance? Mate just messaged me to transfer everything out of it
!!comment!!: And yet again i wait for a dump and the market keeps going up couldve had 3 cheaper buy ins
!!comment!!: There was a moment where we were approaching 6 million members in here and it seemed close. Now I feel like the numbers are going down… Seems like people are bored and don’t wanna bother being in here. Sure things are slow but there’s still a huge community and I always enjoy the crypto discussion in here even if most of it is bullshit. Gotta take the bad with the good
!!comment!!: Feels weirdly refreshing to see some alts having a little run up though it most likely wont last
!!comment!!: Looking more and more likely we’ll break 17k resistance
!!comment!!: Prices on CDC seem to be consistently slightly higher than on CB
!!comment!!: RIP to those who tried shorting Gala yesterday 🙏
!!comment!!: Do we expect a bad day Tuesday following the Fed meeting? 

a lot of bearish sentiment on twitter
!!comment!!: Good *early* Morning to everyone from Asia ❤️.

BTC seems like it's gonna break out so let's see... anyway hope you all have a good day ahead 😊
!!comment!!: And there was much rejoicing.
!!comment!!: Good morning from Australia! It’s a nice Green Day and a great start to 2023!!! Mining fiat from home today. Slow day will spend some time with the kids who are still on holidays. See you all later!
!!comment!!: I love how times have been so bad that like a 1-4% jump gets us absolutely ecstatic.
!!comment!!: Oh wow the charts are giving me dopamine!!! It feels amazing!!!! This is just the start?
!!comment!!: Scary to see so much green in my portfolio, I'm not used to it 😭
!!comment!!: One day closer until the next bull run

We're gonna make it!
!!comment!!: Another day, another daily.
!!comment!!: New daily :) less than 10 ppl here
!!comment!!: Damn it's quiet here!🤫 Quiet or you'll wake everyone up!!
!!comment!!: ADA just grinding to the upside 🤩
!!comment!!: Usually when ADA pumps, BTC decides to crash and ruin the party. Lets see how this plays out
!!comment!!: haha I really can't catch any crypto luck. Used the little bit of BTC that I cashed out from before I got wrecked..and the new year starts using that to buy a ssd drive that Amazon said they delivered when they didn't.
!!comment!!: The one thing that has been predictable in crypto lately has been the crabby weekends.
!!comment!!: What do you guys think the dopest raspberry pi crypto project is?
!!comment!!: Tezos up 10+% on the 1 week chart 👀
!!comment!!: Marking exam papers, completing an online course, doing some data entry and preparing for a return to work tomorrow. Yes, I'm a leave everything to the last minute person
!!comment!!: The cycling subs are taking over my feed. Good sign I suppose.
!!comment!!: Serious question: are many things in crypto pretty complicated to handle for "normies" because the builders are in kind of a bubble of devs & nerds, thus what seems easy and obvious to them is to complex for others?
!!comment!!: I came back to crypto after half a year... looks like I really can't escape
!!comment!!: I really miss the days of making a ridiculous amount of money on a daily basis by farming in ponzi dex's across multiple chains.
!!comment!!: Wow.  Much quiet in crypto land.  Clock just ticked over to Sunday here in PST.  How’s everyone’s Sunday going?
!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - January 17, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: Day 7 of fiat mining in 2023 and not a single day I’m not exhausted. So much work.

But good to see the green vibes in crypto lately.
!!comment!!: Really bummed I had to sell my moons. Hopefully I can accumulate more in a month for not to much more
!!comment!!: Good morning everyone. Europe waking up and DCAing!
!!comment!!: didn't think I would ever say this but I just broke even lol I can now buy exactly at my average price
!!comment!!: Texas A&M is introducing a Bitcoin course into its curriculum this spring.

Do you think Bitcoin alone or cryptocurrencies should be incorporated into college education?
!!comment!!: One day closer to owning my own home. 🍻

In crypto I trust!
!!comment!!: I'm so thankful that I live in a time when something is booming and I am here for the ride.

To be able to buy some free time is all I ask for, this 9-5 bullshit isn't getting me anywhere.
!!comment!!: Btc Struggling to get over the 21.3k from early November. Lets do this.
!!comment!!: dollar stopped dumping and stabilised, stocks stopped the pump, new floor price for BTC at $21k

now we wait lol
!!comment!!: Well [this](https://imgur.com/a/ngXF7yX) just happened and I am done trading for the day 🥳
!!comment!!: To become a whale you first must act like a whale, eat 2 million calories of shrimp and swim across the Atlantic and then you will have million in crypto
!!comment!!: Just noticed the bitcoin logo has two little legs and two arms in the air going yay.

Clever.
!!comment!!: Eth has been carrying my entire portfolio. What a beast.
!!comment!!: Jim Cramer is seeing bullish signs for the stock market, so that means the run is over soon I guess.
!!comment!!: I don't dream of becoming a millionaire. It's enough for me to get my initial investment back
!!comment!!: Is it safe to get out of the coma?
!!comment!!: My stocks are outperforming my crypto today. I guess that's a good thing.
!!comment!!: If we can only get a small Asian pump tonight…
!!comment!!: Just one day to go, any predictions for moons ratio folks?
!!comment!!: What time is the snapshot guys?
!!comment!!: Watch us keep going up while while stocks crash this year. Almost certainly if they go down hard, then we will go down hard, but it's a nice thought.
!!comment!!: People didn’t buy at 15k because they wanted to buy lower. Same with 16 and 17k. Now with 21k. They will always wait to buy lower and end up buying at ATH
!!comment!!: Last 2 cycles we’ve had a double bottom before the bull run started. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see that kind of structure again in the coming year
!!comment!!: Just let it happen bears. Stop fighting.
!!comment!!: I cannot wait to be financially independent with crypto and lose all my money on stocks
!!comment!!: I see ETH ending this year in $7000-10,000 range. Smart contract growth is about 150% each month and there is no more selling pressure from miners.
!!comment!!: Green days have come again
!!comment!!: Algo squaring off before the next big jump.
!!comment!!: mining stocks like MARA and heavily shorted ones like CB should run this week
!!comment!!: BTC at 21k making me feel like I don't need my morning coffee
!!comment!!: We are consolidating nicely and resetting the RSI levels. Next move up soon? 
Lets see how the Us Markers will do today.
!!comment!!: Futures down slightly, let's see how markets look later this morning.
!!comment!!: I love when buttcoiners have so much confidence in everything they say, such as: “This pump only happened because Binance printed 6B USD out of thin air”

I wish I had this much confidence in everything I say in life
!!comment!!: Goodnight all from Australia ❤️💚❤️💚 i havent been that active but ive been enjoying the pumps
!!comment!!: Very bullish sentiments across the board
!!comment!!: Was expecting a bit of red this morning but so far it’s holding the line.
!!comment!!: It seems like bitcoin is about to take off but… Cramer has officially death kissed this rally…
!!comment!!: There’s Lugano, Switzerland, and Bitcoin Beach El Salvador, and Bitcoin Island Philippines. If you had a choice, which part of the world do you want to see turned into a BTC haven?
!!comment!!: Wishing you all a great week ahead 🙌
!!comment!!: I was promised blood. Instead, I have received crabs.
!!comment!!: Hoping for a pullback to blast us off like a slingshot
!!comment!!: Casper had a big pump. Binance listing rumours I guess.
!!comment!!: We haven't been this much above the bull market support band since March 2022 when we went to 48k and dropped to 39k and the second last time was during ATH
!!comment!!: New daily in t minus 15 minutes
!!comment!!: [Packs your bags](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FmpyTx8X0AAtB0o?format=jpg&name=4096x4096), guys and girls. Jim Cramer ruined us.
!!comment!!: Definitely a quieter day today than I expected! The stock market stayed pretty flat and crypto pretty much stayed around the weekend levels. Nice to still see BTC at 21k after last weeks rally!
!!comment!!: 2022 survivors - are we pretty much numb to any downward price movement?

I mean, don’t get me wrong, there’s always the potential for major dumps and/or slow and steady bleeds like we saw last year, but at this point, it’s more like “I’ll just buy more” rather than 😱
!!comment!!: Cramer seeing bullish signs forming in the stock market

Inverse cramer rule kicks in. 

Might be in for a surprise now
!!comment!!: Whale investors do not appear to be selling into the bitcoin rally, a sign of increasing confidence.
!!comment!!: There goes 21k, again *sadface*

Edit: Annnd it's back *happy face*
!!comment!!: My one biggest mistake was VeChain, should have just stuck to Bitcoin/ETH
!!comment!!: CB card renewed 4% xlm rewards for another month...I'll take it!
!!comment!!: Guess they're liquidating some shorts before sending the elevator down.
!!comment!!: Don't be affected by the noise. 

Ignore it and stay on course.

DCA & chill.
!!comment!!: I think we will crab through the night
!!comment!!: I thought something would happen today but guess not. Damn crabs.
!!comment!!: Very slow day in here today… might not even break 1.5k comments
!!comment!!: I have some BNB in Trust Wallet and I want to exchange to BTC and maybe a little XMR. Would anyone happen to know of a good guide I can follow?
!!comment!!: I’m proud to say that the only crypto I’ve been shilling in the sub during the bear is performing so well
!!comment!!: It finally stopped being boring
!!comment!!: The world is gonna 🚀🌙after the US shows yet again what a shitcoin the USD is this week
!!comment!!: - Inflation is too high in my country!
- government removes the vat for the basic products.
- grocery companies push a +20% in the price because less taxes doesn't need to mean less price. And a bit more because why not?
- government increases the income taxes because you can't collect less while airdropping money ad infinitum.
- extra: somehow the official cooked inflation number goes down.
!!comment!!: So, during the lead up to Christmas, I’m at my local shopping centre and I find one of those pop-up stalls that had hundreds of different led neon light signs.  There were a lot of Disney characters a few marvel, many fancy car brand logos, Xbox/Ps logos etc but what surprised me was the ETH logo. What surprised me more was the XRP logo! I looked for a long time, but didn’t recognise any other crypto logos. Is crypto now so mainstream that it ranks up there with Mickey Mouse, Captain America’s shield and Mercedes?
!!comment!!: I was expecting we’d be dumping by now. Amazed how long this green has gone on for. Kinda bullish
!!comment!!: Was able to work on editing a presentation during a dreaded work meeting. Although this meant that I couldn’t shitpost then, the sense of liberation I derived from finishing the presentation meant that I am surfing the sub stress-free now. Happy end of fiat day!
!!comment!!: -90%: I'm calm

+20%: I ShOUlD qUIt mY JOb aND dO ThIS fULL TImE
!!comment!!: BTC around 21k since 3 days, any suggestions for next position?
!!comment!!: One month Curve OP incentives 🔥 
https://i.imgur.com/hee8ArN.jpg

Edit: this is for ETH staking
!!comment!!: Guess i'll keep on staking until steak!
!!comment!!: I am predicting a quick dip when the markets open.  We will see how the rest of the day reacts.
!!comment!!: Avax running. When will my boy algo run up like that
!!comment!!: Crazy that bitcoin has gone up for 14 straight days. Trailing the record by one day
!!comment!!: Been on the fence about buying back into AVAX for a week I feel like I'm too late. I'm gonna hold long-term but I feel like it's dumb to do it after such a fast pump.
!!comment!!: *And we can build this dream together*

*Standing strong forever*

*Nothing's gonna stop us now*

*And if this world runs out of hodlers*

*We'll still have each other*

*Nothing's gonna stop us*

*Nothing's gonna stop us now*
!!comment!!: My bags haven't moved for a month. Defeating the urge to chase pumps is harder than quitting smoking
!!comment!!: Link has been bleeding against Eth for more than 50 days in a row, a +30% in the ratio. Guess that the staking for very few has been a bit disappointing.

One less to check to swings for a while
!!comment!!: BitBoy is saying we will easily go to 30K within 45 days. 

God, I hate him.
!!comment!!: I'm not impressed by the bears, seems like they're struggling to even get below 21k
!!comment!!: I became a tenth of a coiner today - I think this is maybe the only place on earth that can appreciate that. It feels like a legit achievement.
!!comment!!: hopefully this daily will be full of green market comments. hoping the markets will not sell off as they open again after a long weekend.
!!comment!!: The volatility is back on the menu
!!comment!!: DCA this Friday, what will the market bring?
!!comment!!: Looking at my crypto portfolio balance and having to calculate how much more it’s gone up since the last time I looked is getting exhausting
!!comment!!: So recession is cancelled I guess
!!comment!!: I had to sell 1k moons because life came up. Take care of those moons for me 😭
!!comment!!: Can’t wait to do a dance and pop champagne once we hit new ATHs. I know it’s a long ways off, but I’m still confident that day will come!
!!comment!!: all right boys and girls, i just put $25 in bitcoin. pamp it. lets go.
!!comment!!: One day closer to home ownership.

Snake God and crypto help us.

!!comment!!: 2023 will be green. Trust me bro! How green? Fuck knows
!!comment!!: You guys don't know many bullish/green jokes, right?
!!comment!!: Grrr

Time to put CDC customer support to the test!

!!comment!!: Avax is doing some crazy shit
!!comment!!: GALA about to break out of its bull pennant 😎
!!comment!!: still not convinced we've seen the bottom. too much uncertainty in the macro before money will want to start flowing into such risky assets like crypto
!!comment!!: Wohooo my portfolio is only down 50% 😂
!!comment!!: 17,999 are u serious lollll
!!comment!!: Probably not the start of the next bull run but if you weren’t part of it last time. Remember this feeling… it lasted for months
!!comment!!: ok BTC, ok, you got my attention
!!comment!!: Only need another 200 consecutive days like today and I'll be back in the green!

!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: My CEX has some "leveraged tokens" under the "ETF" tab with names like "ETH3L" and "SOL3S". The text explains these are leveraged long buy and short sale tokens which perform 3X more (better or worse) than their respective base tokens. How does this work? Could someone make like a 100X version?
!!comment!!: Is GALA just gonna slow bleed now after going crazy?
!!comment!!: So now that the lebanese lira has collapsed and its state is still getting worse and worse lebanese people are turning to crypto as a last hope. Is it plausible to think crypto is good enough for us in Lebanon to put our savings in or should we revert back to gold.

Coinbase is going good as well. The whole picture is nice to see for now.
!!comment!!: Thinking of selling all my moons to buy some Wendy’s. What you guys think?
!!comment!!: All I want to know is who thinks we'll get a 25 CPI tomorrow
!!comment!!: If FTX fiasco hadn't happened, would BTC be over 20k right now?🤔
!!comment!!: 0.75 BAT so far this month. I guess I need to use my laptop a bit more.
!!comment!!: Dodged a bullet: a guy wanted to be friends with me in DM few days ago just scammed another guy for Reddit Avatars.
!!comment!!: This is a good, honest crab market. We trade 7 days a week. Salt of the earth, punch the clock, even green/red ratio. We lose a couple, guess what? We'll win a couple, too. But don't get too excited or let it go to your head. No long win streaks here, no sir. That's hubris, which this blue collar, hard working everyman market doesn't have. A few green days in a row, this market, true to form, will balance it out with a couple a red days. Yes sir, that's my 2023 crypto market. A good, honest .500 market.
!!comment!!: I'm just sitting here staking my alts, dreaming of the day the bull run comes back and I can take a dump on my boss' desk.
!!comment!!: I have metamask for ETH and BSC, Phantom for SOL and Pera for ALGO. But where can I keep BTC out of exchanges?

!!comment!!: How is everyone this fine day?
!!comment!!: questions to veterans:

what happens once the bear market is about to over and it's very early bull market stage , new retail folks come in and start buying those shining new projects and get easy gains.

do the fallen bear survivors bagholding 80-90%  down projects start feeling depressed watching those easy gains of new investors ?

what does it feel like?
!!comment!!: Glad to see positive sentiments are awakening .
!!comment!!: Well the stock market ended on a green note today. People must be betting that the CPI data will be good tomorrow.
!!comment!!: Is ethereum the next big hodl?
!!comment!!: Wtf is this bullshit, Avax is making me serious money
!!comment!!: Relief rally? Or beginning of an uptrend?
!!comment!!: Good Morning from Asia.

Hope you all have a great day ahead 😘..
!!comment!!: couldn't resist, jumped on AVAX
!!comment!!: Just learned Reddit has stopped giving out free awards for people to give out, what a shame I liked giving them out every few days
!!comment!!: I'm only 25% down now. The magic of averaging down.
!!comment!!: Ethereum doing a power move damn
!!comment!!: Is this the price in before the CPI announcement? Dont really trust this pump
!!comment!!: HOLY GREEN DILDO!!
Have we seen the bottom?
We might we might not
!!comment!!: IT’S WORKING! IT’S WORKING!!!!
!!comment!!: *pops the champagne*

Enjoy it folks, you earned this.
!!comment!!: Looks like my $20 is propping the market up like I hoped it would. You’re welcome everyone!
!!comment!!: If JP fucks us tomorrow I’m gonna be very unhappy with him

!!comment!!: Red day following a green day

That’s why DCA is easier for mental health
!!comment!!: 9 people here, where is everyone ?
!!comment!!: Do we bite into this pump ?
!!comment!!: I may not be able to buy anything for a 3-4 months, something happened and I need to help my family financially :(. Good luck to all of you who will be DCAing, I wish you sweet profits. I'll be lurking around :)
!!comment!!: I just got an email from MetaMask (not actually MetaMask, definitely a scammer) saying I need to manually upgrade my wallet to keep my crypto safe and provided a link. The last statement of the email is: “We highly recommend you upgrade your account as soon as possible. With upgrading, you will lose all your crypto.” Hahahaha I think they meant “without upgrading” but I love how they were straight up about saying they’ll take my crypto.
!!comment!!: People who chase 100x moonshots are dreamers. I’m far more conservative and just want BTC to double in value 7 times.
!!comment!!: Finally claimed my Cosmos airdrops and damn it feels good
!!comment!!: I need NFTs. Any guidance?
!!comment!!: Someone bought 30k Moons at 0.09 and trying to sell again for a quick profit at 0.1 :D that won't work buddy, not with such low volume.
!!comment!!: what are your favorite 3 altcoins (beside of ETH) for the next bullrun? let‘s shill some coins and create some hopium for everybody!!

Market is up 1.2% to $885B
!!comment!!: Higher timeframes and long term wealth…but damn does it feel good to see the old portfolio green at least for a day
!!comment!!: Logan Paul *sigh*

Not only is he in hot water for CryptoZoo, he's got abandonment issues too and not in that sense.

"In 2018 Logan Paul adopted a pig Pearl. Recently Pearl was found in an abandoned field nearly dead with mangled ears. She's now safe at an animal sanctuary thanks to the kindness of strangers."

I appreciate it's not flat out Crypto News but this guy is surely becoming the worst person of decade?!

!!comment!!: The "obviously not a pump,but we took it like a pump" actually lasted.lmao.good job everyone
!!comment!!: Question: Is it called Inverse Cramer or Reverse Cramer?
!!comment!!: When everyone is waiting for a dump its probably not gonna dump right?
!!comment!!: Listened to a podcast with a vapid ftx employee last night. She had zero experience and they gave her $200 in doordash credits per day.
!!comment!!: Maybe we have a nice upside since yesterday but the real endboss is sitting on 19,7k $
!!comment!!: Pump signals that the FTX contagion is over, at least imo.
!!comment!!: My family will live to eat another day because of the spike.
!!comment!!: Jim Cramer said sell crypto again and cut off friends who try and to keep you in crypto
!!comment!!: Finally in the green. Feels good! I'm going to enjoy it while it lasts.
!!comment!!: do you strongly believe a lot of alts will die off in the next run? i’m not talking about complete shit coins? because i am 50% alts and 25%btc 25%eth and i really don’t know if should convert to btc and eth and start re buying alts. i’ve calculated if all my coins were to hit ATH again i would have around $25K but if i convert to either btc or eth i would have $20K at their ATH
!!comment!!: Zil doing good moves based in nothing. Feels weird to remember some longs to +0.2... and it was like 10 months ago (and is ~90 down). Time flies in a bear
!!comment!!: Wtf… CDC delisting USDT in Canada…?
!!comment!!: After yesterday’s green day, I wonder what FUD will bring us down today.

!!comment!!: I was finally able to change my avatar from the default one. Hopefully I can snag a new NFT when the next one drops
!!comment!!: Good thing cramer said we should get out of crypto. Bro you are a few months too late. We buying rn
!!comment!!: ![gif](giphy|12aW6JtfvUdcdO)

Me when the market pumps 5% :D so dumb, but exciting to see some green again.
!!comment!!: What? GALA is not $5 yet? _goes back to sleep_
!!comment!!: Had the sort of day at the fiat mines that has me longing to be able to quit and never go back, sacrificing a snek to the daily to bring the good times back for all of us.
!!comment!!: If you see a random nft in your wallet, don’t click it, it’s scam.
!!comment!!: Just saw this headline in a rival sub. A very interesting fact and a good one for crypto if true -

almost 78% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply is illiquid. This leaves less than 22% of all mined BTC on exchanges. The metrics show that investors have been storing BTC in their custodial wallets and avoid selling.**15 million BTCs** are now held in self-custody. This is extremely good.
!!comment!!: So now that we know Busd was partially backed for some time, anyone else find it extremely shady that binance converted everyone's stables to Busd without their consent?
!!comment!!: Man oh man we are really teasing $900B in MCap across the crypto space. What a weird day of trading in trad markets too. One meme stock is up 118% on the day. Insane.
!!comment!!: So we back to "what we buying now" mode? I really missed that
!!comment!!: Another day, another DCA. Not concerned about how the market looks. Just sticking to what I know works
!!comment!!: I don't know who needs to hear this, but include BTC in your DCA, even if it's just a little. 

I know too many people who only DCA into alts and don't bother with BTC because they don't feel they can make the same gains. This is a mistake.
!!comment!!: I fully blame Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic for spoiling the fun with his comments. Can't wait for Thursday though. The next few weeks are going to be big!
!!comment!!: The price always goes up right before I get paid and DCA
!!comment!!: okay guys.. it’s time to shill me your alts. what are your 5 favorites at the moment?

Next to volume, it's percentages. If I were noob, I'd think the percentages represent change in volume since that's what they're next to.

You are aware of the Fear and Greed Index but do you know the Bitcoin Misery Index? It is an index that measures Bitcoin’s price action using a range of 0 to 100. The score is derived by using the percentage of winning trades to total trades and volatility. As such, scores below 27 may spell doomsday and induce “misery” for existing investors, but may signal buy opportunities for new investors. 

*Do you use the BTC Misery Index in your decision-making process?*

!!comment!!: I extracted the insights relevant to BTC so that you don’t have to scan through the report:

Bitcoin Findings from Messari Crypto Theses 2023:

The Mt Gox bankruptcy proceeds, which amount to a total of 137,000 BTC, may be distributed in early 2023.

Bitcoin’s parity with gold would yield a 25x return, so there’s a lot to like in adding a 4% position in digital gold for every ounce of gold you buy. At today’s prices, Bitcoin-Gold parity would bring us a $500,000 Bitcoin.

Current Bitcoin Lightning Capacity is about $90 million. Wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum (WBTC), which is just 10% of the TVL in DeFi applications, is 40x larger.

Bitcoin mining produces a lot of e-waste annually, about the same amount as a country the size of the Netherlands. Only about 17% of this e-waste is recycled today.

Bitcoin miners have been using wastes and stranded energy sources like flared methane, stranded geothermal energy, coal refuse, and even recycled waste tires. Hence, the narrative that Bitcoin mining is damaging to the environment may need to be relooked.

The wasted energy from flaring in the U.S. alone is equal to 78% of the energy used by the global Bitcoin network in 2021. Repurposing flared energy towards Bitcoin mining would drastically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.

Bitcoin mining can help strengthen renewable energy grids as renewable energy is unpredictable and results in excess energy during off-peak times that results in energy producers curtailing that energy. Miners can be a constant energy buyer of last resort, increasing profitability for renewable energy operations.

!!comment!!: Well 2023 begins with a trap or not.but it's nice too see green.
!!comment!!: I don't understand how people's brains work. When Solana was at 9.9$ no one was buying. And suddently it gains 40% in 2 days, back to 14$, everyone wants to buy. Until they are surprised it doesn't go up anymore. they lose money or hold bags. rinse repeat.

It's actually scary and funny how the brain gets conditionned by the colours red and green.
!!comment!!: These little relief rallies remind me a bit of how a bullmarket can feel
!!comment!!: I’m living that 1ETH lifestyle now fellas - picking out lambos as we speak.
!!comment!!: Nice to see ATOM turned $10 into support 💪
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: So Pi coin has dumped to $75... another 33% down in the last 24hr.

!!comment!!: Crypto is in the green so far this year!
!!comment!!: Good afternoon lads! Just finished the fiat mines n enjoying the rare visual feast of refreshing greens for my crypto portfolio. May this greenery last!
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: 2024 is going to be a great year
!!comment!!: does anyone here besides me, has a feeling that this year will be a CrabYear? Slow, and without huge market price movements? Imo great time to accumulate some more
!!comment!!: I'm wondering where will mining industry go? with eth's pos, a miracle with other mineable cryptos havent occured. Secondhand market of devices has been down for months. Need another crypto that will rescue pow crypto
!!comment!!: A younger me used to fomo in fake pumps like this. Now I pause for a few seconds, then say what the heck...and jump right into the market providing exit liquidity for the 100th time.
!!comment!!: Might just blow the rest of my capital on ETH and BTC tonight and call it a year
!!comment!!: 20 wallets hold 50 percent of all the BONK. What could go wrong?
!!comment!!: Crypto barely is up , chill guys , keep the DCA going
!!comment!!: Somebody pls confiscate SBF's laptop
!!comment!!: Crypto ramping while futures flat lol. Gotta love it
!!comment!!: Is it just me or does Coinbase slightly raise the price of a crypto when buying?
!!comment!!: Good morning, fellow crypto regards! Seems like we are going to have a nice price action today
!!comment!!: Time to FOMO my life savings into this pump and take out a loan too
!!comment!!: To get something you never had, you need to do something you’ve never done.
!!comment!!: With so called "SOL reversal" with meme coin  BONK launch

I have come to realization that Crypto is actually swimming pool for whales where shrimps are trying to ride the ripple waves :)
!!comment!!: Goodnight daily🐍 to all the degens. Take profits, especially if you can sell half your bag and play for free.

!!comment!!: Good morning to everyone except that piece of shit Logan Paul
!!comment!!: Unbelievable Safemoon is still on top 200 and LUNA still on top 50.

People really are degens
!!comment!!: Soon we will hit 6m subs! And we're in a bearmarket.
!!comment!!: This subreddit never talks about low caps, but everybody wants to buy them **after** rallying X20 in a week. You're doing it wrong, you have to buy them **before** the pump.
!!comment!!: Looks like a lot of you haven’t learned anything after being down 97%
!!comment!!: Gooooodmorning everybody hope we all have a good hump day 🐪
!!comment!!: DCA and Stake. My simple 2023 plan for success!
!!comment!!: ADA up 10.53% on the 1s candle (11:38:56 UTC on Binance, EUR market)

Bullrun is back! ^(/s)
!!comment!!: Ah yes, 5% up after 90% down. Time to FOMO
!!comment!!: We are so used to crabbing that a small pump like this gets us hyped up.
!!comment!!: Bonk shitcoin also got added now on my exchange. If its a
Shitcoin they are fast
!!comment!!: I love a meme coin just as much as the next person but I think when the tides turn it will wipe out the memes.  Greed never goes away but I think people will be smarter with their money this time around.   I had way too much meme coin exposure in 2020/2021.  It’s all I knew.  After doing okay through no skill of my own and getting out with a tidy profit, I actually started researching what the hell I was buying and why I was buying it.  I consider myself one of those that jumped in for the hype ,hoping for a quick buck, but decided to stick around. FOMO for random coins is slim to none anymore.  I’m sure there are others in the same boat which may help determine which coins make it.  I would be very suspicious of meme pumps going forward.  2023 could become year of the bagholders.
!!comment!!: Flare snapshot is like the ultimate con 🤪

Buy Xrp for an airdrop and 2 years later get 15% of what you was promised! 😂

!!comment!!: Here we go, first movement in what feels like forever
!!comment!!: Alt season for ants? I’ll take it.
!!comment!!: I opened a long on Solana just to collect funding fees at -1%
!!comment!!: I just gave my first Snek to the daily... why do we do that?
!!comment!!: Sorry guys but I’m about to do my DCA sorry if it goes down
!!comment!!: I will wait 2usd in cro:) for that 2usd cro dude
!!comment!!: One day closer to the bull!!!!
!!comment!!: Ugh, might need to take a break from the daily. It's too shilly in here lol
!!comment!!: Well, Bonk-mania confirms the bottom well and truly is not in.
!!comment!!: In other news: Savage and Samsung have partnered and which platform did they choose? Polygon of course
!!comment!!: It's tempting to short SOL and SRM right now, but I know it'll just get another leg up as long as that BONK hype is still there 😂
!!comment!!: I was unaware of BONK.

Kinda wanna short it, kinda wanna not get burned hard this year.
!!comment!!: Logan Paul's beverage brand name to be changed from 'Prime' to 'Crime'.
!!comment!!: Jim Cramer hating on crypto as always just now. Calling it a ponzi

!!comment!!: SBF’s RobinHood shares have been seized. Wish they also seized ‘his’ crypto assets before allowing him to dump.
!!comment!!: Is there a reason why COINBASE stock is up 12%?
!!comment!!: ADA seems to be performing quite well over the last days, relative to other gainers.
!!comment!!: Say what you want, but $BTC performing better than many stocks during this bear market is extremely bullish long term
!!comment!!: Just purchased a nice espresso machine from Bonk gains. Now officially out of Bonk but hope it runs nicely for everyone
!!comment!!: ADA 75% off sale
Ends soon
!!comment!!: I can finally comment. This is my first.
!!comment!!: This daily is so fresh and so clean
!!comment!!: If you haven’t been DCAing a little bit every day bitcoin is below 20, stop waiting. Even if this pump isn’t the one, you don’t want to miss the boat like last time.
!!comment!!: A moment of silence for my friend who held SOL for many months and then SOLd under $10
!!comment!!: I’m so ready for this year. 

Still sober. 

Still rocking my sweet new avatar!  Gonna switch it up, but 1st.

!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - January 5, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: That is a sexy 1 week chart. 

Now we just need to do it again next week.

And the next.

And the next.

And then the next 30 after that...
!!comment!!: Wild how many people spam comments about Bonk and Sol (both Ponzi schemes), but almost completely ignore credible cryptos that have done well this bear market like Litecoin. 

Yeah, I know, “degens going to degen.” This excuse doesn’t make sense anymore. This isn’t a bull market. Those same “degens” that are flocking to Bonk and SOL could’ve made the same if not more if they had invested in LTC over the past 6 months. 

It’s making me think a lot of comments regarding these Ponzi schemes are disingenuous and possibly deceptive.
!!comment!!: It was been 20 days since Bitcoin closed a day outside of 16k-17k. That's committed crabbing.
!!comment!!: Watching paint dry is more exciting that bitcoin's price action the last 5 weeks. Record breaking low volatility
!!comment!!: Imagine putting your BTC into Gemini earn for 1% or whatever it was per year and getting rugged.  Unbelievable.  I'm glad I knew lending crypto was 🚩🚩🚩, still feel bad for these guys, getting rugged for 1%.
!!comment!!: JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US DOJ to seize Sam Bankman-Fried's $575 million Robinhood $HOOD shares, prosecutors say.

https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1610721114006724608
!!comment!!: I am now getting $2 of ETH per week from staking. 

It's not much but it's mine.
!!comment!!: New DCA strategy. Putting $1 into BTC & ETH every time I see a comment talking about BONK
!!comment!!: Proud of myself I'm not even tempted to chase this next big thing that will stay nameless
!!comment!!: Feel like BTC has been in between $16.6k - $16.9k for such a long time
!!comment!!: It's nice to be reassured that crypto has a heartbeat after all. It'll be a bumpy 2023 but the worst is behind us, fingers crossed.
!!comment!!: BONK up 158% … lol people never learn.
!!comment!!: Lots of volatility last 2 days
!!comment!!: Do you feel a little fomo guys? (i.e. increasing the DCA amount per week/month?) just curious :)
!!comment!!: Does anyone else accidentally click on the “Monthly Optimist Discussion” and start reading the comments wondering why everyone is being so positive and then realize you’re not in the daily? Because I do
!!comment!!: What do you think it will happen first?  
\- Aliens contact Earth

\- Civilization on Mars

\- BTC leaves the 16.6-16.9K range
!!comment!!: what's the current mood on polkadot around here?
!!comment!!: The only staking I be doing is at the Texas Road House
!!comment!!: I just want us all to make it
!!comment!!: Aaand Bonk is dropping like a tonne of bricks. Who’d have seen that coming
!!comment!!: To think cardano was once named 'eth killer' 🫠😂
!!comment!!: Panic selling of Bonk started, Very unsurprising.
!!comment!!: Another Day, another DCA.... These prices are too good!
!!comment!!: If I knew then what I know now
!!comment!!: Accumulation of BTC and ETH becoming rote at this point. Wake me up in a year
!!comment!!: It was the best of times (for crypto lawyers), 

It was the worst of times (for cex users),

*It was the age of Bonk.*

2023 lol.
!!comment!!: The money I found for boink is now in cosmos. Like always I had to take the scenic route.
!!comment!!: Just another day in cryptoland. Hope everybody is having a good start to the new year.
!!comment!!: I'm not buying BONK, but at the same time I'm not shorting it. Those telling to short BONK at the top are saying something easier said than done. There are already a few times where the price made ATH then dumped the next 30-45 minutes only to make new ATH.

If someone placed a short when it dumped after setting ATH, you'd have been liquidated 3-4 times this past two days now 😬
!!comment!!: Snek for the daily! Keeping up my snek streak for 2023 👍
!!comment!!: Welcome to the Bonk daily! Discussion on other coins is discouraged, but permitted.
!!comment!!: Federal authorities have seized or are in the process of seizing more than $400 million worth of Robinhood Markets shares tied to bankrupt cryptocurrency firm FTX.

!!comment!!: Did some digging on Logan Paul’s “Cryptozoo”…

My god, some people will sell their souls for their favourite influencers.
!!comment!!: We are very deep into the Red Lobster Crab Fest market. It’s all you can eat, but there is only one choice
!!comment!!: Hows everyone portfolio looking today?
!!comment!!: All I want is a chance to prove that money can't buy happiness
!!comment!!: I’ll never not get a kick about people on Reddit calling NFTs stupid while their little hexagonal avatar smiles next to their comment.
!!comment!!: I just got here today but it seems the bonking has really intensified.
!!comment!!: Goddamned... the one time I decide not to Fomo into some Shitcoin it totally takes off..
!!comment!!: Feel like I should Chuck  $20 at bonk but also knowing rationally if I’m hearing about it now it’s too late
!!comment!!: I donated a snek to the daily. We must honor the crypto gods
!!comment!!: MEXC now has futures trading up to 20x for BONK…this is dangerous information!
!!comment!!: One day goes by, one day closer to getting out of this sucky phase.
!!comment!!: I like crypto and believe in it….

Can I’m not be a critic anymore?!

Is that how this works?

Kinda like when Micheal declared bankruptcy

!!comment!!: Is XRP going to win the lawsuit or not?

!!comment!!: Reminder: Bonk spelled backwards is Knob.
!!comment!!: Bonk -50% in less than a day 

No one saw it coming
!!comment!!: Perma bears are just as bad as perma bulls. We're very near to the bottom, buying here is an opportunity. Just stay away from leverage unless you're an experienced trader and even then keep it under 5x
!!comment!!: Don’t get FOMO with BONK. Don’t get FOMO with BONK. Don’t get FOMO with BONK.
!!comment!!: Founders and Co founders of SOL endorsing BONK. Why?
!!comment!!: R.i.p to all the idiots who FOMO'd into Bonk
!!comment!!: i really can't fucking wait for the day i can tell my boss to go suck a bag of dicks
!!comment!!: So 2022 finished, this will be bull year ?
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: To anyone wondering if this is the start of the bull… I assure you I have no idea
!!comment!!: What’s better than crypto? COIN up 12%
!!comment!!: Something I like to remember when reading many of the posts here” imagine the intelligence level of the average person. half the world is dumber than that.” Then I just buy btc or eth.
!!comment!!: Is this the correct daily? I'm confused
!!comment!!: Are we finally seeing an upward trend in the market that’s going to stick around?
!!comment!!: Like my grandfather told me once to encourage me: *"Keep pushing through, don't give up! You've got this."*

I remember this to get strength to fight against adversity. We got this pals.
!!comment!!: Only 1 Snek in the Daily 😳
I make it 3 you make it 5… Deal?
!!comment!!: How do I know how much is my avatar worth?
!!comment!!: Do you guys think I should sell my mining rigs? I came in at a vert bad time. I bought them about 4 months before the ETH merge.
!!comment!!: So is 16.9-17K the new “lower high” before we take another leg down?
!!comment!!: can't remember the last time BTC was above 16.9K or below 16.6K. It feels such a lost memory now
!!comment!!: BTC is less volatile than sp500 lmao
!!comment!!: sorry guys couldnt hear you over the sound of my dreams collapsing
!!comment!!: Just another crabearullish day, my friends.  We riding the kiddie coaster.
!!comment!!: Rug pull just rug pulled.. Shocked!
!!comment!!: 
Trading crypto has really been a learning experience like I learnt that I'm not good at trading
!!comment!!: Does anyone still mine pi?
!!comment!!: A nice lil pump occured yesterday, but seems like today we're loosing positiong and are declining..what was it a bull trap? Or how is that figure is called, I gorgot?..
!!comment!!: How do I check for airdrops in Keplr?
!!comment!!: When I went to take a break, bonk was dumping. Now it's trying to get back up again.

Those degens aren't going to let this go quietly, are they?
!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: watching this whole BONK fiasco from the sidelines is kinda nice. i dont have to worry about the volatility... just get to sip my drink and watch the chart
!!comment!!: Good night, everyone. Lets hope we don't find new some rug pull to lose all our savings tomorrow.

Stay safe out there
!!comment!!: Someone please tell me why I shouldn't go all in with half of my emergency fund I am about to pull the trigger I am filled with so much copium someone pull me out
!!comment!!: Good morning daily! It's good to be back in Australia! The charts are stable, and it's a brand new day and a brand new year! Hope everyone is doing well. Back to work from Monday next week so planning to clean the house out today. Should be fun! See you all later!
!!comment!!: Good morning family! I was wondering what do u think it could be the best crypto for daily payments?
!!comment!!: Maybe a stupid question but what is the meaning of that flair i got under my name? Seen people with fun stuff and stupid shit and was wondering what is was
!!comment!!: Good morning lads. Off to the fiat mines. May your portfolio be full of luxuriant greens!
!!comment!!: I feel the need to officially state that I have NOTHING to do with BONK, and I do not condone this misuse of the term. As grand emperor bonosaurus the first, I will be taking legal actions....maybe.
!!comment!!: 2032

Son: When BTC was 17k why didn’t you buy any?

Dad: I bought dogshit coins instead

Son: 😭
!!comment!!: [deleted]
!!comment!!: >So you’re telling me if I just did the opposite of what this sub said yesterday I’d have doubled my money? 

This aged well with Bonk losing more than half its value since this was posted earlier in the daily
!!comment!!: Is anyone else’s DMs full of scammers lately? Bullish sign if you ask me
!!comment!!: I don't know why CKB is doing so well but I will take it
!!comment!!: Whoever buys BONK during peak bear are most likely the same that haven’t made ever profit with crypto
!!comment!!: So I wonder how many are actually bots that are talking about bonk so much 🤔
!!comment!!: bonk folded faster than a, uh, folding chair
!!comment!!: I suspect we will crab again today.
!!comment!!: This coffeziila vs Logan Paul rivalry made me like already the 2023
!!comment!!: Anyone else just see the btc chart jump up  a decent amount of points and go right back down?
!!comment!!: Second day at the fiat mines for 2023 has been completed. Many many many days to go
!!post_title!!: Daily General Discussion - January 3, 2023 (GMT+0)
!!comment!!: Today, last year, the last of the Bogdanoff twins died (six days after his twin brother) of covid. They were famous, at least in CC, for the ***"He sold? Pump it"*** meme. RIP
!!comment!!: I know we are very much in the depths of a bear market and we have a while to go before we get out but I feel calm, it's letting me DCA and accumulate and not feel FOMO that the price is going to sky rocket. While not ideal I am fully prepared for another 9-12 months of this
!!comment!!: If ATOM keeps going a bit more it might get the rank 23rd too. Not too far from top 20 either.
!!comment!!: Tesla is down more than BTC lmao
!!comment!!: Don’t forget to stake that ATOM 🥩
!!comment!!: Fun fact, my portfolio has been green for the whole of 2023

Optimistic for 2023.

!!comment!!: [removed]
!!comment!!: Good morning crypto enthusiasts! First day behind charts in 2023 and in mines. Let's make this year ours

!!comment!!: Good morning daily fam! I’m heading to a winery for brunch and then some lazing around looking at scenery here in NZ. Last day here before hitting the grind.

Current Litecoin block reward is 12.5 LTC, after the halving, the block reward will be 6.25 LTC.
!!comment!!: As we approach 6 million members in r/cc what tips do you have to give to the ones already here? It seems the ideology of HODL might not work out for some as we have found taking some profits could be wise. Is DCA still the name of the game too? What’s your viewpoint?
!!comment!!: Happy 14th Birthday Bitcoin 👑
!!comment!!: What comes first?

- Ada's L2 making the network usable when compared with any other working L1 smart contract (it only outperforms, and not always, to Eth mainnet)

!!comment!!: After the past year, I can't tell you what a relief it is to be green YTD
!!comment!!: I keep wondering if ETH would've actually reached 10k in 2021 if the merge happened before the bull run. It would've been ridiculously deflationary with small issuance.
!!comment!!: It is your birthday. @BTC
!!comment!!: so cramer was wrong this time also with both ltc and sol

3. "Elon Musk's SpaceX will launch the “DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon” in the first quarter of 2022" - never happened.
4. FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried: Solana Has a Real Shot at Becoming the Next Bitcoin (2021) - never happened
5. Cardano’s Founder Charles Hoskinson Exposed for Misleading Claims About His Ph.D. Enrollment - shit happens, but why lie?

Have fun stacking, folks!
!!comment!!: Getting up at 4am to go back to the flat mines after a couple days off is the worst, hopefully the next bull run will give us all a little more freedom in our lives.
!!comment!!: Wow didnt realise i clicked over 30k total karma for my account! 99% of that is from here, thanks guys 😁😁❤️

!!comment!!: I was just informed today is Bitcoin's birthday. I will celebrate by buying some. Anyone buying anything today?
!!comment!!: People looking to buy as it's the new year and 2022 is over, I'd still wait a few weeks. The downtrend and turmoil will continue Q1 2023 I think. I'd wait for the Fed rates on Feb 01 to see the sentiment ; there's also the BOJ situation with the Japanese bond market which no one is talking about, which could (will) shake things up. Interesting coming 3 months.
!!comment!!: Yea sell this little pump from this day . As usual 🇺🇸
