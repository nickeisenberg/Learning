!!comment!!: You can tell who is new when they're complaining about the market being irrational, my man stonks only go up that's all you need to know.  Sometimes they do go down, but not for long, and when they stop going down they go up.  Stonks already went down, they aren't going down again, and if they do they aren't going down lower than they already did, so they're going up.  If this seems irrational, it is you who is irrational.

Jerome Powell walks out on stage, says inflation is no more as he has hiked rates 5.5bps. Everyone begins freaking out at the economic turmoil that is sure to follow, markets begin tanking immediately. JPow quiets the room, he announces a joint plan with Janet Yellen and Biden to print 100 Trillion USD for stimulus checks to every US citizen ($100/person) the rest will go to banks. "This should prevent a recession", he says. As the crowd cheers Powell whispers into the mic, "fuck your puts, fuck your calls" before leaving.

The economy never recovers.

Stock market volatility is back to levels seen in late trading on Friday, while **bond rates are ripping lower** with 10y Treasury down 16bps and the German Bund yield down 23bps. The Dollar Index is down by 0.4%.

————————————

Stop trading 0DTES.

Never trade before 10am. 

Always have a 20% mental stop. 

Use 3 minute candles instead of the 1 minute I was using. 

Be reactive, not proactive. 

Do not nickel and dime the premiums when buying or selling.

Never doubling down on losing trades.

Never hold overnight.

& ffs never play earnings ever again. 

I hope this helps!

How can anyone keep a straight face anymore thinking things are ok… 35% of the US revenues will be going into debt servicing this year, they’ll over spend by a trillion making this number 38% next year and so on. It’s laughable
!!comment!!: We may never see a red day again
!!comment!!: I know a lot of you are dumb and only read headlines so I’ll summarize for you since you like being frustrated instead of informed 

The Fed raised rates quickly. Not 1970s quickly but quicker than the rest of the world. The labor market is too tight and keep spending money. They don’t want to force a recession and know inflation won’t be coming down quickly.

Instead of forcing inflation down via a recession they are looking for slow interest rate hikes over a much longer period of time. They are targeting now 3 years until inflation is down but this will also be slower and steady enough to stop a recession. 

Now where you’re confused and frustrated: the $2T for non-mega banks is so they can have liquidity for 1 year instead of going under like SVB. Giving the bank time for their bonds purchased during Covid to recover value and offset unrealized losses. Ideally, in 1 (most likely 3) years, the bonds will be at face value or more and the Fed will remove the $2T from the cash supply. There’s huge restrictions in which this $2T can be used, and ideally will not directly impact inflation.
!!comment!!: Let me get this straight, the Fed gave banks an out for their idiotic bond/MBS purchases through the discount window. They got $148 billion more than usual through the discount window and proceeded to bet it all on stocks?
!!comment!!:  Infinite QT for poors with inflation, infinite QE for banks  Welcome in the great reset

!!comment!!: The world will remain on the precipice of global collapse until the market makers face the real consequences of their risky market plays so that the market can truly reset. Politicians keep this fake market propped up for two reasons: money and legacy (both noble motivations).

Money: if they let the market experience a TRUE RESET - their money is essentially gone because they’re in too deep. 

Legacy: no politician wants to be remembered as the organization in power when the market died.

Until some brave soul comes around and is willing to go down with this ship and consequently implement TRUE banking reform, our market will continue to remain completely divorced from reality.

 A market crash requires nothing more than an increase in the risk premium demanded by investors, in an environment where risk premiums have become overly depressed.

-	2 Large banks experienced run on the bank failures
-	3-4 more are on the verge for the same collapse
-	FDIC went out and decided to break lawful protection act with Treasury’s agreement to bailout those banks
-	CPI came in as 6% (on top of the already existing high inflation from last year)
-	Core inflation increased MoM

With all of that crap, the market is mooning with bullish performance.

SVIB, a bank had so much money deposited from the easy money era last couple years, they decided stupidly to buy 30-year bonds, suffered a significant loss when bond yields plummeted after a sudden rise in interest rates. In an effort to cover its deposits, SVIB sold $20 billion of its bond holdings, incurring $2 billion in losses. Now, the bank finds itself in a position where it must sell an additional $60 billion worth of bonds. Doing so would result in losses totaling $15 billion. The bank's overall deposit equity stands at $16 billion. This implies that selling $60 billion of bonds would wipe all of the bank's equity.

If you knew how fractional banking worked you Obv were aware, but now the confidence game is up and I expect bank runs all over with folks withdrawing cash to put into treasuries etc 

The potentially catastrophic part is that every bank in the US is in a similar situation to SVB. If there is an accelerated withdrawal tempo, these banks will come under immense stress bc they are all holding long-duration assets that were bought in a zero interest rate environment and now those assets are under water.

I have traded while on the job making profits from $300 to my best day being $4600 on an $5k account, and I’ve also lost a few grand in a day, but I’ve learned, ran into a few day traders at my job and talked for a few hours and have discovered the magic of base hits over home runs.  I feel like I’m young enough to go for my dream way to spend my time and take the risk. I will be starting with a $3k account with 3 month’s of expenses saved up on the side so wish me luck! Im excited to take the risk and go for it!

!!comment!!: Like for the love of god, how is anyone supposed to trade in the market? Just reversal after reversal every week. Are we bullish? I don’t know! Are we bearish? I don’t know! Did you buy puts today because we’ve been trading lower for the past two weeks? Yes! Did we skyrocket $7 for no apparent reason! Yes! Is half of your account gone after a 5 day winning streak? Yes! Why is this happening? TO KEEP THE POOR POOR AND THE RICH RICH! That’s why! It’s so unfair that it’s disgusting. I hate this. Just go to work every day for 50 years so that you can die poor while the rich get richer and the middle class disappears. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. All I wanted was to try to make a measly 10% of a put because we were overbought and in a down trend. But every time I get ahead the market acts “irrational” and all the gains are wiped out. This is a scam and I hate it.

!!comment!!: Many years ago, the mother in law gave my BIL and SIL 40k towards a house. The wife and I asked if we could expect something along those lines. MIL said " we do good for ourselves and that she wouldn't be giving us anything towards our house". Many years later we moved across the country, and offered my FIL ( they have been divorced for a while) a plane ticket to see us since he lives in grinding poverty in Ohio. MIL found out and asked if she was going to get a ticket as well, all I had to say was "nope since you do good for yourself."  I might be a dead man soon but fuck that was worth all this wait.

You can get 100k to go to art school where there’s no expected return.  I don’t listen to all in podcast anymore but they had an episode basically saying if the loans put normal banks at risk, the whole problem would solve itself and actually lower cost of college.

Colleges are gonna charge as much as they can get away with, it’s like how homes went up 40 percent with low rates, all that matters is the ability to finance it 

Forgiving current debts does zero to prevent the problem in the future so it’s not even addressing the root problem

This is heading towards everything being monitored and carbon taxed with the justification being "the environment" so next time you're out with someone and they spout Al Gore environmental garbage about the polar bears - call out the hypocrisy and tell them what financial purpose this social cause is clearly being exploited for.

You use google every God damn day most likely as a consumer. Coinbase just had a federal suit dismissed/settled and you think a Google can't get out of a suit. Oh no. Worried bout chat ai. Google has had an internal chat ai bot for years but d/c'd it in house a year back. Now they are using that to make their own version that already can retrieve info in real time via Google search network. Oh and they also did mass layoffs and have buckets of cash so can do buybacks.

!!comment!!: I've got 20k worth of SHOP calls. Here's my reasoning if anyone wants to make a poor last minute decision:

1. They raised prices and I imagine the turnover was almost non-existent. As a ecom store operator, there's nowhere else to go. It would cost wayyyyy more for a store to switch to a new platform than it is to stomach an increased price. They could raise prices 5 times and probably see very little turnover.
2. Q4 was the strongest quarter for online sales since the early pandemic. They only benefit on the processing fees, but it was a very good quarter for ecom.
3. Layoffs to fluff the numbers
4. They just announced a ton of new functionalities for this year

AKA guidance should be strong. And praying for the holy grail of stock pumping - the buyback

!!comment!!: You can always tell who is a bad trader by the people that blame the market for their own failures

“Trash market today” “clown market” “these idiot bulls/bears”

Any iteration of that kind of sentiment indicates the person is lacking 1) emotional regulation 2) analytical introspection

You are the sole responsible party for your own trades. It is literally your job to be smarter than the market…which includes anticipating when it will enter a “clown” phase so you can profit from it.

3pm - 6pm EST - market close and earnings junkies. these people are the ones who gamble on every earnings call. they also lose the most amount of money on WSB. low IQ mostly

7pm - 10pm EST - the "futes" gang. these people are obsessed with SPY futures for some reason. every other comment is "holy shit futes rippin" or "omg futes blood red" and they all think it will matter the next day when it has no correlation

11pm - 5am EST - this is where shit actually gets fucked up in here. the truly weird people come out and start posting creepy and crazy shit. literally no comments are related to stocks. its all comments about sex, drugs, criminal activity, depression, cocaine, etc. entertaining but also creepy AF

6am - 8am EST - pretty quiet

!!comment!!: DFV inadvertently killed this sub with the gamestore pump.

WSB had a culture and usually people that joined would lurk first and learn before commenting, otherwise they’d get shit on relentlessly by everyone. 

Then 10 million normies joined overnight and shouted over all the people that were here and basically erased it all. It’s a husk of its former self

Nowadays you cant even call someone a regard you have to say Regard. Not like this site isn't still a useful tool but... fuck do I miss it man.

Im happy WSB blew up during the pandemic and got actual recognition for its work but, at the same time that notoriety forced alot of great people out of here. Cant have it all can we.

/u/Initial-Willow3935 made a bet that SPY would go to 700700.0 within **1 day** when it was 411.999 and it did not, so they were banned for a week.

Their record is now 0 wins and 2 losses

Yesterday's data shows that the red day was not driven by anybody selling anything, but from hedge funds shorting. But no one actually selling because everybody is underweight equities, they have nothing to sell.

So the shorts will get cucked again until more institutions increase more equity exposure.

!!comment!!: Jerome Powell sits at his desk, tears were forming in his eyes. "God Damnit!", He shouted, the fiscal quarter GDP numbers were rock solid again. Jerome looked into his small desk mirror. "You're a fucking failure!", He said to himself. "The president gave you one job! Just one job and, now people have to take out a loan to buy eggs!" He continued to himself. Jerome Powell looked away from his mirror, and then down at his lap, and then at a small drawer for emergencies only. Inside was a small box that had "Property of Chairman Volcker" engraved on the side of the swing open lid. Jerome knew what he had to do, "but they'll hang you if you use it" he thought to himself. "I'll hang myself if I don't", he thought back. Jerome tidied himself up a bit, and opened the drawer, removing the small engraved box. Jerome Powell would save the economy. Even if he had to destroy it first.

!!comment!!: When you see a whole bunch of "YOLOs" on a stock after its run 400% in 4 days..., that's definitely when you sell.

I can't imagine the level of FOMO required to buy a stock after a run like that.

1. Buy overpriced option
2. Go slightly green
3. Reversal to red
4. Deep red
5. Slow climb back to breakeven
6. Up bigly
7. Get greedy
8. Crash to -50%
9. Wait for breakeven, again
10. Sell at -80%
11. Watch it climb to 10 bagger
12. repeat

Works every time.

Don’t panic when the price tanks. You must always do your own DD !

Like me! I started off with 200k, some youtube video that I watched convinced me to yolo on a particular meme stock.

I ended up losing 80k and selling at a loss.

After that sad experience I started to do my own DD and started to read and learn about investing!

After days of "training", I have finally developed my own ideas and investing strategies!

l ended up losing the remaining 120K.

Inflation isn't going away - 2023 is your time to be heartless to your employer and shop yourself around. Job hopping to a higher salary is your best option to outrun inflation and get ahead in 2023. Fluff those resumes, exaggerate those accomplishments, and grab that bag!

Stock Specific

Usually there's a brief run up before hand, and on green days, this buy will usually lead to more buying after. On negative sentiment days like today, SPY usually falls after the green candle is done.

It'll pump on the 50 point announcement then decay as the committee expects 5% by March and possibly more by June. My take. Unemployment is still too strong to support anything under 50 for the next 2 meetings. Rates will hit 6% by December next year.

!!comment!!: Welcome to WSB!

The top strategies of ‘22 have been:

1. Inverse Sentiment - do the opposite of what we say is going to happen

2. Inverse the Inverse - once enough people are inversing sentiment, inverse the inversers 

3. Inverse downvotes: post your opinion… did you get downvoted?.. well, you might be on to something 

4. Inverse Cramer: do the opposite of what screeching suited man on CNBC advises you to do

5. Inverse yourself: so, you’ve been losing… great! now, it’s time to do the opposite of what you think is going to happen. But only if it’s also the opposite of what WSB is saying (unless their being downvoted) 

6. Inverse inversing yourself: after you’ve been inversing yourself for some time, your subconscious might know that you’re going to choose the opposite of what your thinking. Your brain may try to trick you into doing something that you think makes sense... Knowing this, inverse what you think, and then inverse it again 

7. Inverse logic - no one knows shit about fuck


And always remember…

It’s not you. You’re great. It’s manipulation

While goods inflation is now negative at -2.5%, and housing has flattened out, dipping slightly into negative territory at -0.3%, wage inflation continues to disappoint, rising at a 1.7% rate." *puts glasses down and grabs podium*. "Until another million or so people lose their jobs and wages stagnate for the lower and middle class in line with the past 40 years, we are going to keep ~~fucking your calls~~ our rates elevated. Remember, we want to see a robust labor market, but we just want it to be in line with 2% inflation."

!!comment!!: I was walking around the city earlier today. I saw a beautiful tall, long-legged Asian lady walking towards me. We locked eyes, I smiled, a rush of tingling through my entire body. I felt things I'd never felt before. The connection was real, and this is exactly like what you see in the movie - a dream come true. As we pass shoulder to shoulder, I catch a scent of her perfume, it's sweet, almost summery and I know she would of caught a wif of me too as I'd been wearing my best fragrence my mother bought me. I get a strong urge and tell myself "I can't let this pass, it feels like fate", so I begin to turn to face her as she's now a meter or so behind me. I'm delighted to see she is beginning to twist back towards me. This is it. We lock eyes once more, the connection even stronger this time, I smile yet again ready to speak the language of my people. Her mouth moves to match, it opens, revealing sparking white teeth and out comes the words "creepy cunt".

!!comment!!: Inside day yesterday and probably more consolidation in a balanced session today. Would be a setup for a significant directional move off PPI tomorrow. PPI will drive sentiment and px til CPI Tuesday. If CPI echoes PPI then there will just be some continuation into FOMC Wednesday. But if CPI surprises the other way, then there'll be a significant countertrend move into FOMC.

Currently holding QQQ 290c 12/16 @2.55 as a small bet on PPI, but if the print is hot tomorrow I'll short a larger position in /NQ to offset the Qs and hold short til Tuesday. If PPI undershoots, then I expect a breakout above balance area possibly running back up to 4100 before CPI Tuesday

!!comment!!: The professional consensus on the jobless numbers is 228k, with 210k-254k range. If it comes in higher or lower than the range, it shows: 

1) the pollsters are asking the wrong professionals, 

2) the professionals are using the wrong data points, or 

3) nobody really knows how to project this number accurately, so at best the consensus is a wild guess.

Good luck in your trading day.

A harrowing sight to behold,  
As stocks and shares begin to fall,  
And investors start to fold.  
  
The fear and panic on Wall Street,  
Is palpable and clear,  
As markets plunge and fortunes lost,  
In this great financial fear.  
  
The once mighty titans of industry,  
Are now reduced to rubble,  
Their empires built on sand and smoke,  
Now crumble in the rubble.  
  
But even as the markets crash,  
And all seems lost and bleak,  
We must remember that the sun will rise,  
And a new day will soon peek.  
  
So let us not despair,  
But rather hold on tight,  
For in the end, we'll rise again,  
And once more, we'll take flight.

Then you ask him if he was aware that a car with similar body shape and color sped past you about 2-mins before he pulled you over.

When you get pulled over, knowing in advance that you're gonna fight it in court, tell the cop that I think you meant to get the other guy that just zoomed past you.  He'll put that in his notes.  Then when you're in court it will seem like your story is consistent.  Plus if he doesn't show, you win.

Inflation must be our first priority; lowering inflation with aggressive tightening is the lesser of two evils. *But of course, I concede that at some point in the future, the Federal Reserve will consider slowing down this historically aggressive hike cycle.*"

They have spread out the VOL and can now take people out day by day instead of week by week. 

Y'all though this was a gift from the gods but its really just incredible risk management from market makers who will hose you even harder now. 

Index options may as well be dead now for short term plays. The amount of people in weeklies was probably causing wild swings that they can't manage as well as they can with the risk broken down into smaller pieces.

!!comment!!: Here's a recap of the FTX drama that's on the verge of killing the corn market:

-	FTX creates their own version of corn out of literally nothing.
-	FTX then “gifts” their homegrown corn to a trading firm owned by FTX’s CEO.
-	The trading firm then takes out loans using the FTX corn as collateral.
-	Anytime the trading firm needs to puff up their balance sheet, they just have FTX grow more of their special corn and gift it to them.
-	A competing corn exchange company also holds a large amount of FTX corn and is currently liquidating their position entirely, purposefully driving the price down to force the insolvency of both FTX and the trading firm owned by the CEO of FTX.
-	FTX is the world's 2nd largest corn exchange by trading volume, their insolvency will likely destroy the corn market.

This is a private company based in the Bahamas printing their own money and using it to manipulate a trillion dollar market. And cornbros willingly invest in this type of environment?

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Thanks, but no thanks. I think I'll stick to writing OTM 0 DTE SPY options to be bought up by WSB degens.

Edit: Binance and FTX have "come to an agreement on a strategic transaction." Wow, looks like this was all a hostile takeover by Binance. Amazing maneuvers by Binance, genuinely exciting to witness in real time. And now everything pumps.

Edit 2: …well that pump was short lived. The excitement continues with FTX corn **dropping over 70% in less than 24 hours**.
